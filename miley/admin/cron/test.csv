For this reason, all new Western Rim developments are now constructed using strategic, proven soundproofing methods that ensure residents a quiet home, minimizing the noise of surrounding neighbors. ‚Äúbusier than ever as consumers search for quiet‚ÄùTweet this Professional soundproof technicians are now ‚Äúbusier than ever as consumers search for quiet,‚Äù according to the New York Times, as an innate issue of dense, vertical apartment properties is the constant noise from surrounding units being heard in others. Music, footsteps, and even chatter all have the tendency to bleed through floors and walls, creating a disturbance to adjacent neighbors. Hiles‚Äô strategy involves implementing effective soundproofing methods as new apartments are being constructed, eliminating any potential sound issues from the outset. All new Western Rim projects feature double-thick walls between homes, and 18 inches between floors. Remaining space between walls and floors is completely filled with cellulose, an efficient, optimal sound-muffling material. Marcus Hiles has established a reputation for constructing upscale suburban communities in close proximity to major urban centers throughout Texas. The solace and enhanced privacy inside each apartment unit is a fitting complement to these features, providing a true refuge from the outside world. In addition to soundproofing, the materials and methods used serve another purpose as well, helping to reduce carbon emissions and overall energy costs -- an important goal of Hiles for each property. Marcus Hiles is Chairman and CEO of Western Rim Property Services, a real estate development company managing over 15,000 luxury residential rental homes, townhomes, and apartments throughout the largest urban areas in Texas since 1990. Hiles consistently provides significant financial contributions and land donations to the cities across the state. About Western Rim Property Services: Western Rim Property Services, Inc. develops, owns, and manages apartment homes in Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, New Braunfels, San Antonio, and Houston, Texas. Known to offer a contemporary, high quality and luxurious lifestyle to its residents, the firm‚Äôs mission is simple: build the highest quality homes in the very best locations, maximizing views with signature amenities, in superior school districts.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail February 25, 2017 11:58 AM Eastern Standard Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE )--By 2020, more than three-quarters of all online display advertising revenue will come from mobile, according to new analysis released today by IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. ‚ÄúRegions like Southeast Asia are benefiting from the rise of a middle class, consumerism, and a mobile-first young population. The emerging Asian markets present a huge business opportunity for the trio to export its video content, games and e-commerce abroad.‚ÄùTweet this ‚ÄúMobile advertising has grown stronger than any other medium in the last four years, and now accounts for a significant proportion of online advertising revenue,‚Äù said Qingzhen Chen, senior analyst at IHS Markit. Global trends Global mobile display advertising surged 72 percent in 2015 compared to the previous year, and accounted for 45 percent of all online display advertising revenue, with a total of ‚Ç¨29 billion. In 2016, worldwide mobile advertising will grow 42 percent, to $41 billion and for the first time will generate more than half‚Äî55 percent‚Äîof all online display advertising revenue, said the latest IHS Markit white paper. Regional highlights: China China has maintained its growth momentum despite economic restructuring, but the real growth engine comes from online. With roughly $33 billion in revenue for 2016, the Chinese online advertising market is the second largest in the world. Online grew 17.5 percent in 2016 and will grow 14 percent in 2017, driven by a strong growth of online video (51 percent and 32 percent growth, respectively). ‚ÄúIn 2016, the Chinese online ad market went through some turbulence and reshuffling,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúChina introduced its first set of online advertising regulations, which in the short term had reduced online advertising revenue, but in the long term, we expect to see a more sustainable online ad ecosystem from this development.‚Äù On the other hand, after a period of rapid growth, TV has entered a third year of consecutive decline with a single-digit contraction. Many people are switching to online for content consumption and seeking wider range of content, from foreign content to user-generated content by popular vloggers. TV in China declined 2.7 percent in 2016, and IHS Markit expects a 3 percent drop in 2017. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent -- known collectively as the B.A.T. in China --own 36.5 percent of the total ad market with a total of CNY 160 billion ($24 billion) in 2016. ‚ÄúThe trio has absorbed large TV brand budgets and online ad budgets, and continues to expand aggressively into digital,‚Äù Chen said. The trio made a total of 262 investments, 27 acquisitions and one joint venture between 2009 and 2016. Mobile app companies received most investments from the trio for that period. ‚ÄúAs Chinese companies go global, investments in nearby countries will increase,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúRegions like Southeast Asia are benefiting from the rise of a middle class, consumerism, and a mobile-first young population. The emerging Asian markets present a huge business opportunity for the trio to export its video content, games and e-commerce abroad.‚Äù Meet IHS Markit at Mobile World Congress Meet IHS Markit analysts at Mobile World Congress from 26 February to 2 March 2017 in Barcelona.

That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows operating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment and derivative gains/losses. Although the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment gains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire‚Äôs operations, investing activities are independent of the insurance underwriting process.

Also honored were seven surviving Santa Clarita veterans of World War II. The funds raised at the event will be used to complete the remaining 24 homes of a 78-home neighborhood for low-income veterans in Santa Clarita. The event took place at the Universal Sheraton Hotel in Universal City, CA. The event, with 470 guests in attendance, raised $291,000. Princess received the Hammer of Hope Award from Congressman Brad Sherman. The Hammer of Hope is this Habitat‚Äôs highest honor and is presented to extraordinary individuals or entities who are leaders in their fields and communities ‚Äì specifically those who serve veterans and low-income families seeking to enter the middle class. Past recipients include Anheuser Busch, Home Depot, Citibank, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, The Gas Company, Primestor, and many others. Accepting the award on behalf of Princess was its Vice President of Public Relations, Brian O‚ÄôConnor. Princess is a longtime sponsor of Habitat for Humanity SF/SCV and a few weeks ago hosted a TEAM Build at which Princess employees spent the day building veteran homes. WW II veterans being honored with a special tribute at the event were Lou Brousseau (Army Air Corps), Cal Erickson (Army Air Corps), Rex Gribble (Army Air Corps), Lloyd Lubensky (Army Air Corps), Richard Roelofs (Navy), Lee Shulman (Army Air Corps), and Tom Tucker (Navy). The award was presented by California State Assembly Member Dante Acosta. Completion of the veteran neighborhood in Santa Clarita will bring Habitat‚Äôs total to over 400 homes to date. Next year, they begin building 56 more Veteran homes in Palmdale and 12 Veteran homes in North Hollywood. What makes this Habitat affiliate even more special is their belief that, in order for families to truly be successful, affordable housing must include a supportive environment that encourages self-sufficiency in a neighborhood culture. This program, called the Enriched Neighborhood¬Æ model, provides no-cost programs such as financial training, health and wellness programs, and social services that are easily accessible in the neighborhoods where the families live. This allows their families to become self-sufficient and learn skills and necessary tools to move out of the endless cycle of poverty housing and into the middle class. These programs are especially cherished by returning veterans as they seek the comfort of others returning from service and the strength to reintegrate successfully into their community at home. This year‚Äôs event was chaired by Karen Brown, Sr. Vice President of First Bank, and hosted by actress Alison Haislip, sideline commentator for ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúBattlebots‚Äù and celebrated pop culture TV, podcasting and webcasting personality. Other elected officials in attendance were California State Senator Robert Hertzberg, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, Santa Clarita Mayor Pro Tem Laurene West, Los Angeles City Council Member Paul Krekorian, and Santa Clarita City Council Members Bob Keller and Marsha McLean.

Some of those considerations are as follows: Though CNMMA originally sought the recommended age restricts to be 21 years old, it believes the task force‚Äôs recommendation of 18 strikes a necessary balance between protecting youth and reducing the demand for black-market products. Though CNMMA still encourages provincial governments, as they develop distribution framework, to consider on a case-by-case basis whether their current minimum ages for alcohol would serve to reduce both harm to young people and the impacts of restrictions that drive willing consumers out of the regulated market and into the illicit one Public safety is of utmost concern when developing this legislation. The CNMMA is satisfied with the task force‚Äôs recommendations in this area, specifically those that make reference to graduated sanctions for impaired driving. CNMMA suggests that if all laws surrounding marijuana use are addressed via a dedicated legislative act including those for impaired driving, that medical users be held to the same expectation of responsible use. Quality of product is important to ensure in the new legislation. The federal task force report refers to a system of supply management with the intent of controlling price. The CNMMA is concerned that a licensing model based on limiting supply would reduce market diversity and draw the focus away from rewarding producers that innovate and consistently produce high-quality products. The purpose of the Canadian National Medical Marijuana Association is to ensure all Canadian patients who benefit from medical marijuana in Canada, have access to the highest quality of product and services, to meet their specific health care needs in a safe, well-regulated environment.
