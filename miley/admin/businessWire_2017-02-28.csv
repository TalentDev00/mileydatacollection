RDC seamlessly combines routing, dispatching, trip management, proof of delivery, Hours of Service and Driver-Vehicle Inspection Report (DVIR) compliance. This offering, which brings together the best of Omnitracs’ Roadnet Anywhere and XRS solutions, is available on mobile devices for drivers and through a single management portal to fleet operators. The solution addresses a challenge that distributors face when managing their transportation assets. Typically, companies rely on multiple, unintegrated systems to handle routing, driver performance management, mobile delivery management, and compliance. RDC seamlessly integrates these capabilities, thereby improving ease of use for the driver while simplifying data management and reporting for fleet management operators. RDC provides fleets with real-time information about routing efficiency, tracking, safety and compliance. Features include route planning/optimization, telematics to monitor driver and vehicle behaviors, a driver mobile platform that includes electronics logs, trip management and proof of delivery. It also includes a web-based management platform that has dispatching, Hours of Service and DVIR compliance, and comprehensive driver score carding. “Many fleets find it very difficult to effectively balance needs around route efficiency, driver safety and compliance, and customer service,” said Kevin Haugh, chief strategy and product officer at Omnitracs. “In fact, fleets can easily be pursuing actions that are at cross purposes. For example, developing route plans that fail to fully account for potential negative compliance effects — such as creating hours of services issues. With RDC, managers and drivers can easily balance their business needs by having a comprehensive perspective on all aspects and the ability to quickly make adjustments as needed.” For example, a driver that encounters congestion and is running behind schedule might be dynamically rerouted to avert potential hours of service issues. In addition to streamlining visibility and agility both inside and outside of the cab, benefits of RDC include: Electronic Logging Device (ELD) Mandate compliance, reduced costs and fleet miles through efficient route planning, reduced time through simplified reporting and data review, increased accuracy and the flexibility to adapt to customer needs and route changes.

The leading-edge MARS platform enables users to reconfigure cameras with different lenses, image sensors, image signal processors (ISPs) and communications options for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The system is so flexible that it can be used for the full spectrum of automotive camera applications including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), surround and rear viewing systems, in-cabin cameras (for gesture recognition, driver eye monitoring, or light level inspection purposes), and autonomous driving. New innovative modular automotive imaging platform from @onsemi reduces time-to-market and development costsTweet this MARS enables shorter design cycles, reduced engineering costs, and assists automotive design teams in the implementation of imaging systems by providing them with a unique mix-and-match solution. Through it, various items of hardware can be combined in a robust and highly adaptable system with a compact form-factor. Due to the many different boards available, engineers have access to ON Semiconductor’s broad portfolio of image sensors and co-processors, plus various automotive communications protocols from a select group of third party supply partners. This provides extensive scope in terms of finding the combination that best fits specific system requirements. The versatile platform can accommodate an almost limitless number of combinations due to consistent signal/power definitions for the interconnects utilized by these respective boards. The ease of adapting this modular solution means that undertaking time-consuming activities such as creating custom boards (each capable of accommodating a different sensor option), testing out high-speed interface standards, or writing code for drivers, is no longer necessary. MARS is supported by a complete ecosystem, encompassing software development tools, schematics, gerbers, bill-of-materials (BOM) and much more. A comprehensive user guide is also included within the accompanying documentation. “As image sensing proliferates in automotive applications, MARS will provide system and software developers tasked with turning concepts into reliable working applications with a valuable platform to simplify and speed proof of concept and development, and offer the scalability to get ideas from the lab to on-vehicle testing in real-world conditions,” said Ross Jatou, General Manager and Vice President of Automotive Solutions Division of Image Sensor Group at ON Semiconductor. “The flexibility of MARS accelerates the component selection process by making the constituent sensors and co-processors totally interchangeable. The platform avoids the need to construct a multitude of custom boards to house different sensors for evaluation reducing engineering effort and shortening project times.” The support of commonly used communication standards (such as GMSL, FPD-Link, LVDS, MIPI, Ethernet) enables direct interfacing with existing vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). ON Semiconductor is working with an ecosystem of partners spanning lens developers, third party ISP vendors, communications IC vendors, software developers and SoC vendors. MARS modules are already prequalified with a range of these third party products and the company will expand these offerings going forward. Availability MARS development boards are available now.

The key to the market growth is the use of battery packs that are in some cases two to three times bigger than those employed in electric cars just five years ago. By incorporating bigger batteries, the new vehicles will offer greater all-electric ranges. Unfortunately, high costs of lithium-ion battery cells have been one of the main hindrances to large-scale electric-car adoption, as they typically lead to higher purchase prices for electric cars than comparable internal-combustion models. Because of improved chemistry, manufacturing processes and economies of scale, average electric-car battery costs continue to decline. Battery pack prices are expected to halve to $215 per kilowatt hour by 2020 from $400/kWh now. Due to the rapid decline in this cost Exane BNP Paribas predicted that by 2025 automakers will generate bigger profit margins from EVs than from cars with internal combustion engines. As EV growth escalates, the industry would need a global battery production capacity of 600 gigawatt hours, enough to build 8.6 million cars with an average battery size of 70kWh.

Major driving factors for the exhaust system market are increase in vehicle production and the stringency in the emission norms. However, some of the key restraints such as increase in demand for the substitutes such as electric vehicles and high cost of the light weight components could affect the growth of exhaust system market. With regards to the after treatment devices, the gasoline particulate filter (GPF) which is used for GDI engines is observed as the fastest growth market. The system accounts to be fastest market because of its increased use in the GDI engines. The system nullifies the aftereffects of the GDI engines and reduces the emissions from the gasoline engines. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) accounted to be fastest market for diesel variants. The growth is observed owing to the advantages to meet the new emission standards and helps the manufacturer to accomplish the set emission targets by the regional authorities.

Thomas M. O'Brien, TA's CEO, made the following statement regarding the 2016 fourth quarter results: ""During the 2016 fourth quarter, our business strategies resulted in gains in nonfuel gross margin as well as continued improvement in operating efficiencies as reflected in lower site level operating expenses on a same site basis. We grew site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses in total and on a same site basis. Fuel gross margin was negatively impacted by the absence in the 2016 period of an $8.0 million pretax benefit in the 2015 fourth quarter related to biodiesel fuel tax credits; our 2016 performance made up for all but $2.2 million of this amount, however net income attributable to common shareholders declined, largely as a result of increased depreciation expense associated with investments in new locations and existing site improvements that were placed in service during the last year. The combination of our internal and external growth activities outpaced headwinds of increased fuel efficiency for heavy duty truck engines, the impact of competition and a softness in freight volume, resulting in an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of 13.9% in the 2016 fourth quarter versus 2015. Our results also reflect continued improvement in financial contributions from our recently acquired sites, and I remain confident in the prospect of realizing the expected results from these investments."" Fourth Quarter 2016 Business Commentary Fuel sales volume decreased by 8.6 million gallons, or 1.6%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter primarily due to a decrease in same site fuel volume. The same site fuel sales volume decrease was attributed to fuel efficiency gains by TA's commercial diesel fuel customers, new sites opened by competition and a relatively soft trucking freight environment. Fuel revenue increased by $45.8 million, or 5.1%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter due to both newly acquired locations and same site results. Same site fuel revenues increased due to higher market prices for fuel, which was offset by lower volumes. Fuel gross margin decreased slightly by $2.2 million ($0.001 per gallon), to $101.1 million ($0.189 per gallon) primarily as a result of the decline in fuel volume. Nonfuel revenue increased $26.2 million, or 5.8%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter: $25.1 million of the increase was due to sites acquired since the beginning of the 2015 fourth quarter, while $1.1 million, or 0.2%, of the increase was attributable to same sites. Nonfuel gross margin increased $15.7 million, or 6.5%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter primarily due to an $11.7 million increase from newly acquired locations, while $4.0 million of the increase was attributable to growth in same site nonfuel gross margin. Same site nonfuel gross margin in the 2016 fourth quarter was 54.2% of nonfuel revenue, compared to 53.4% in the 2015 fourth quarter, a change largely attributable to the positive impact of TA's purchasing and pricing strategies and TA's marketing initiatives. Site level operating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 2.2%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter: a $9.2 million increase due to locations acquired since the beginning of the 2015 fourth quarter, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in same site results. On a same site basis, site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues improved from the prior year quarter by 1.1% to 49.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the 2016 fourth quarter increased $2.9 million, or 8.6%, compared to the 2015 fourth quarter, principally as a result of increased personnel costs, which resulted from increased field management and corporate staffing required to support the growth of TA's business, as well as planned increased spending on marketing and promotional activities. Real estate rent expense increased $5.4 million, or 8.7%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter primarily resulting from 2016 and 2015 sale and leaseback transactions with Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT. Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the 2016 fourth quarter was $6.5 million ($0.17 per common share) compared to $1.6 million ($0.04 per common share) for the 2015 fourth quarter. The change in net loss attributable to common shareholders was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, and expenses related to financing and managing newly acquired and developed locations (including real estate rent, interest and selling, general and administrative expenses), a decrease in fuel gross margin, and increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in nonfuel gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses generated by TA's locations. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2016 fourth quarter increased by $2.9 million, or 13.9%, as compared to the 2015 fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of the increase in nonfuel gross margin due to both same sites and newly acquired locations, partially offset by increases in site level operating expenses due to newly acquired locations and a decrease in fuel gross margin. Travel Centers Segment Both fuel and nonfuel revenues increased, resulting in an increase in total revenues of $30.6 million, or 2.6%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to increases in fuel prices on a same site basis, plus the addition of new locations opened during 2016. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses increased in the 2016 fourth quarter by $2.7 million, or 2.4%, as compared to the 2015 fourth quarter principally due to an increase in nonfuel gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses on a same site basis, partially offset by a decrease in fuel gross margin. Convenience Stores Segment Both fuel and nonfuel revenues increased, resulting in an increase in total revenues of $34.1 million, or 22.8%, in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to the 2015 fourth quarter. The increases in both fuel and nonfuel revenues were due to locations acquired since the beginning of the 2015 fourth quarter (49 locations). Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses increased in the 2016 fourth quarter by $4.7 million, or 97.0%, as compared to the 2015 fourth quarter due to improvements at same sites and the addition of locations acquired in 2015 and 2016. Investment and Growth Activities From the beginning of 2011, when TA began its acquisition program, to December&nbsp;31, 2016, TA has invested $855.0 million to develop, purchase and improve 318 travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, these investments produced site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses of $100.0 million, or, on a sequential basis, $8.3 million, or 9.0%, greater than site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. TA believes that its investments require a period after they are developed or acquired and upgrades are completed to reach their expected stabilized financial results, generally three years for travel centers and one year for convenience stores. TA acquired or developed 39 travel centers during the 2011 to 2016 period. Of those, 36 are included in the ""Travel Centers Segment Same Site Operating Data"" for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, TA has invested $312.1 million (including improvements) in these 36 locations, and they generated $54.3 million of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The remaining three locations were developed by TA for a total investment of $64.9 million; and they generated $3.5 million of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016; however, TA has operated these locations for less than the full year 2016 (one opened in each of January, March and May). TA acquired 228 convenience stores during the 2013 to 2016 period. Of these, 31 are included in the ""Convenience Store Segment Same Site Operating Data"" for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, TA has invested $66.5 million (including improvements) in these 31 locations, and they generated $11.6 million of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The remaining 197 locations were acquired by TA in 2015 or 2016 for a total investment of $376.9 million (including improvements), and these convenience stores generated $23.2 million of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The 29 convenience stores TA acquired during 2016 were operated by TA for an average of nine months during 2016 and some of these were fully or partially out of service while being renovated. TA acquired one standalone restaurant during 2015 and 50 during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, TA has invested $34.7 million (including improvements) in these 51 locations, and they generated $7.3 million of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. TA's growth activities have also contributed to growth in its selling, general and administrative expenses, which were $139.1 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, a $17.3 million, or 14.2% increase over the amount for the year ended December 31, 2015. TA estimates that approximately $10.0 million of this increase can be attributed to the increase in TA's number of sites, including such items as marketing, advertising, regional management personnel and centralized corporate function support costs. Other Growth Initiatives TA's business requires TA to deliver a myriad of goods and services to multiple customer types from each of TA's locations. TA's business, in particular the travel center segment, also requires significant capital expenditures to remain competitive. In addition to the investments in new locations described above, TA made capital expenditures of $253.7 million in its business in 2016, some of which were improvements of the type TA typically sells to HPT for an increase in rent and some of which were not yet complete as of December 31, 2016. TA believes that approximately $79.9 million of this amount can be considered to be investments to maintain its product quality and competitive position, while the remainder, or $173.8 million, can be considered to be investments designed to provide incremental returns to TA. These returns on investments may not exceed the cost of capital invested on a short term basis. TA does expect, however, that on a longer term basis, and especially during periods of economic and industry expansion, these investments may provide attractive returns. TA is currently undertaking several internal growth initiatives that TA believes have the potential to grow its profitability and that are geared toward a combination of (a) developing and deploying new products and services to be delivered to existing customers and (b) delivering existing and new products and services to new customers. Conference Call: On Tuesday, February&nbsp;28, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, TA will host a conference call to discuss its financial results and other activities for the three months and year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016.

TRAVELCENTERS OF AMERICA LLC | RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES | (in thousands) Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures that are not determined in accordance with GAAP. TA believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table below are meaningful supplemental disclosures because they may help investors gain a better understanding of changes in TA's operating results and its ability to pay rent or service debt, make capital expenditures and expand its business. These non-GAAP financial measures also may help investors to make comparisons between TA and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. TA calculates Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt, as shown below. TA believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful disclosure that may help investors to better understand its financial performance, including by allowing investors to compare TA's performance between periods and to the performance of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate TA's financial performance and compare TA's performance over time and to the performance of its competitors. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations, as an indicator of TA's operating performance or as a measure of TA's liquidity. Also, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts calculated by other companies. TA believes that net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders is the most comparable financial measure, determined according to GAAP, to TA's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. The following table presents the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders for the three months and year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three Months Ended | December 31, Year Ended | December 31, 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders $ (6,493 ) $ (1,608 ) $ (2,018 ) $ 27,719 Add: (benefit) provision for income taxes (4,304 ) (2,619 ) (1,733 ) 16,539 Add: depreciation and amortization 27,844 19,297 92,389 72,383 Add: interest expense, net 7,054 6,084 27,815 22,545 Add: loss on extinguishment of debt — &nbsp; — &nbsp; — &nbsp; 10,502 Adjusted EBITDA $ 24,101 &nbsp; $ 21,154 &nbsp; $ 116,453 &nbsp; $ 149,688 &nbsp; TRAVELCENTERS OF AMERICA LLC | SUPPLEMENTAL SAME SITE OPERATING DATA | (in thousands, except for number of locations, percentage amounts and fuel gross margin per gallon) CONSOLIDATED SAME SITE OPERATING DATA The following table presents consolidated operating data for the periods noted for all of the locations in operation on December&nbsp;31, 2016, that were operated by TA continuously since the beginning of the earliest period presented, with the exception of five locations TA operates that are owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which TA owns a noncontrolling interest.

The cognitive factors of focus, attention and memory are crucial for young adult students aiming for high academic achievement. “Clinical studies conducted by independent scientists who are experts in their fields have found that Ambrotose powder gives a helpful boost in memory, focus and attention as well as providing perceived beneficial changes in well-being,” said Dr. Rolando Maddela, MD, MPH, CCRP, Mannatech’s Director of Clinical Research and Scientific Affairs. “For young adults who are students, Ambrotose products can be a positive addition to a comprehensive approach to academic achievement. Ambrotose may also play an important role in the overall health and wellness of students, a factor that also contributes to academic success.” Dr. Maddela suggests that as little as four grams per day of Advanced Ambrotose® powder or capsules may help support some of the factors that contribute to success in the classroom.

Robert Beyster Distinguished Professor at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. “Research shows that most of the wealth in the economy is realized by citizens who have investment assets or access to an equity or profit stake in a business.” The new report, Having a Stake: Evidence and Implications for Broad-based Employee Stock Ownership and Profit Sharing, chronicles the history of shares in the United States and outlines a series of evidence-based policy ideas for Congress and the White House to consider when drafting a tax reform bill later this year. They include: Enacting tax incentives that encourage companies to offer broad-based profit sharing or employee share ownership to their employees; Amending Internal Revenue Code 162(m) to eliminate the deduction for top executive pay, except for companies that offer broad-based profit sharing or employee share ownership (these deductions cost the U.S. Treasury an estimated $5-10 billion per year); and Creating an office in the executive branch to ensure there is adequate data, research, and analysis on the wide range of policy options concerning shares for the middle class. “This report draws on decades of empirical research about the impact of shares on employees and companies,” said Douglas Kruse, a Distinguished Professor and the J. Robert Beyster Faculty Fellow at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. “Studies show the combination of employee shares and a supportive corporate culture can improve company performance and employee wealth.” Professors Blasi and Kruse co-authored the report with Professor Richard Freeman, the Herbert Ascherman Chair in Economics at Harvard University. Blasi, Kruse, and Freeman previously collaborated on the book, The Citizen’s Share: Reducing Inequality in the 21st Century, published in 2014 by Yale University Press.

Nearly ninety percent of these young employees say they would commit to a job for five years in return for help with their student loans. New survey examines the impact of student debt on young workers and explores potential employer-driven benefits.Tweet this The Young Workers and Student Debt survey polled 502 young workers between the ages of 22 and 33 as well as 451 human resource managers at companies with at least 100 employees. The results highlight the many challenges faced by young workers with student debt and the strong demand for benefits such as financial literacy, one-on-one counseling, sign-on bonuses and student loan repayment. “Young workers feel highly stressed out as a result of the burden of student debt and that debt clearly impacts their health and productivity in the workplace,” said Kevin Fudge, director of consumer advocacy and ombudsman at ASA. “Employers should realize that in order to retain the brightest young talent and demonstrate their commitment to employee well-being, they need to provide concrete and straightforward solutions to help alleviate this burden.” Young Workers and Student Debt highlights how rising student loan debt is negatively affecting young workers’ focus, well-being and retirement planning as well as delaying their pursuit of further higher education. More than 3 out of out 5 young workers say their priority is paying off student loans and not contributing to a 401K or other retirement plan. The research also reveals a gap between human resource managers and their young workforce as to the perceived impact of student loans and the solutions that young workers are seeking in exchange for their loyalty. Key findings from Young Workers and Student Debt include: 1) Student Loans Have Various Detrimental Impacts on Young Workers a. 56% worry about repaying their loan either all the time (26%) or often (30%). | b. 40% report that worrying about their student loans has impacted their health. | c. 55% would like to go to grad school but couldn’t take on any additional student loans. | d. 61% have considered getting a second job to help pay off their student loans. 2) A Lack of Resources and the Burden of Loans Are Hindering Retirement Planning a. 63% of young workers report that they don’t have anyone to turn to for help with regard to paying off their student loans. | b. 75% of HR professionals report that their company does not offer any guidance or assistance regarding student loans. | c. 54% of young workers report that right now, paying off student loans comes first, and they will put off saving for retirement until later. 3) Young Workers Would Respond Positively to Employers Who Offer Student Loan Benefits a. 86% say they would commit to an employer for 5 years if the company helped pay back their student loans. | b. 93% of young workers would take advantage of a sign-on bonus targeted at paying back student loans; 92% would take advantage of a match for student loan repayments similar to a 401k match. | c. 89% would take advantage of overall long-term financial planning. | d. 79% would take advantage of free access to a student debt loan counselor. The survey was conducted online in January 2017 by Regina Corso Consulting. The full results can be found via this link. For more information, please visit asa.org.

With less than two weeks to go before the Saturday, March 11 administration of the SAT — one of the most popular exam administrations of the year — Kaplan Test Prep is providing the following last minute strategies to help the hundreds of thousands of students who are taking the exam this month to reach their highest score potential: Kaplan Test Prep is providing last minute strategies and free prep to help students succeed on March 11 #SAT exam.Tweet this Familiarize yourself with the test directions in advance: Know where to fill in your name and information, and how to shade the bubbles. This will save you precious test-taking time you would otherwise spend reading the directions during the test. Take two or more full length practice tests: Do your best to simulate the test conditions. Make sure you have everything in front of you — timer, pencils, eraser, calculator, water. This is good practice in keeping to the time limit and familiarizing your body with the stress of taking a test that’s nearly four hours. Take advantage of free live prep: Kaplan will hold a live, online Prepathon on Sunday, March 5, between 12 p.m. ET and 6 p.m. ET, free and open to all students, featuring live expert instruction and Q&amp;A with Kaplan’s most highly-rated teachers. To register, go to www.kaptest.com/satprepathon. Try and get into a routine at least four days before the SAT: For example, review math formulas before you sleep, get the right amount of sleep, wake up around the same time and review some vocabulary at breakfast. This way, when you have to wake up early on Saturday and review some notes, your body will be used to it. The day before the exam: Do NOT cram. Also, make sure you know exactly where the testing center is. Do a practice drive to the location if you aren’t familiar with the area. And put together your Test Day package, which includes proper identification — you won’t be able to take the test without it. Test Day: Wake up an hour or two before you need to leave and eat a healthy, balanced breakfast — do not fuel up on sugar that will cause you to crash during the test. While you’re eating, spend some time reading a difficult article (e.g. an editorial in the New York Times or Wall Street Journal). Reading it will help wake your brain up beforehand. Final thought: Take a deep breath. You’ve got this. For students interested in participating in Kaplan’s Sunday, March 5 SAT Prepathon (www.kaptest.com/satprepathon), it is a fun, innovative event designed to enable live SAT review and engagement with some of Kaplan’s most highly-rated teachers and interactivity with peers. From 12 p.m. ET through 6 p.m. ET, at every hour, on the hour, a new segment on a new topic on the SAT’s Reading, Math and Writing section will commence. The six-hour open format is designed to allow students to come and go as needed, and stay for whatever amount of time they feel is valuable for them. Tweets from students who participated in last year’s SAT Prepathon included: “This is literally the greatest thing ever. PLZ PLZ PLZ do this again! :)” “If I can absorb all of the information from Kaplan's SAT prepathon, I can do anything.” “The prepathon was a great idea!

The project transformed an outdated high school through a 324,000 GSF renovation and a 40,000 GSF addition, into a state-of-the-art facility. The multi-phased $75-million-dollar project was completed while the building was occupied. PHOTOS HERE Methuen High School Design by @faainc Wins Design Citation from BSA Annual Design AwardsTweet this The existing 1975 open classroom building was innovative for its time, but was outdated for contemporary teaching methods. Finegold Alexander’s design provides a fresh identity, reconfigures the interior, improves the user experience, introduces energy and water efficiency, and meets program requirements for a four-section educational system. Jury Comments included: “The design effectively incorporates elements provided by the site, and in doing so, tremendously enhances it. This is very successful work, commendably restrained.” “Our team is extremely proud of the design and construction of Methuen High School. We hope it will be a model for similar future projects,” said Regan Shields Ives, Principal, Finegold Alexander Architects. Program goals included new science classrooms, a media center, enhanced arrival and circulation, and putting a new ‘heart’ into the building. There is a new arts and music wing and a 750-seat auditorium and stage, updating technology to professional-level equipment. An infusion of natural light improves the learning environment and reduces electricity. Open common areas, flexible learning spaces, and lively finishes are featured. The main entry now features an atrium, a grand staircase, new signage and lighting. Landscape improvements provide a more welcoming entry and secure circulation.

(NYSE: BNED), one of the largest contract operators of bookstores on college and university campuses across the United States and a leading provider of digital education services, today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter for fiscal 2017. Financial highlights for the third quarter 2017 and fiscal year to date 2017: Third quarter sales of $521.6 million increased 0.6% as compared to the prior year period; year to date sales of $1,531.5 million increased 1.2% as compared to the prior year period. Third quarter comparable store sales decreased 4.9%; year to date comparable store sales decreased 3.6%. Third quarter GAAP net income of $3.8 million, as compared to a net loss of $(3.6) million in the prior year period; year to date net income was $5.1 million, as compared to $2.9 million in the prior year period. Third quarter non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $18.8 million, a decrease of $5.4 million as compared to the prior year period; year to date non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $52.7 million, a decrease of $9.0 million as compared to the prior year period. Third quarter non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings of $4.0 million, as compared to $5.8 million in the prior year period; year to date non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings of $7.8 million, as compared to $12.3 million in the prior year period. Operational highlights for the third quarter 2017: Completed expansion of price match program to remaining textbook stores. Web sales increased for textbook and general merchandise offerings, slowing the negative general merchandise trend from the fall semester. Gained traction with Barnes &amp; Noble Education Courseware, with continued adoptions for the fall 2017 back to school selling season. Comparable store sales decreased 4.9% for the quarter or $25.0 million, driven largely by lower textbook sales of $23.1 million. Consistent with prior years, the Spring Rush period extended beyond the quarter end due to later school openings and the continued pattern of students buying course materials later in the semester. Factoring in the three additional weeks of February, comparable store sales decreased 3.3% on a year to date basis. “In the third quarter, the trends we saw in the second quarter continued, including lower enrollments, a competitive market for textbook sales and a soft retail environment, all of which contributed to comparable store sales declines. We have taken decisive steps to address the dynamic market environment, including expanding our price match program and enhancing our suite of affordable learning materials with OER courseware,” said Max J. Roberts, Chief Executive Officer, Barnes &amp; Noble Education. “We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on expected long-term industry trends, including future enrollment growth, an increasing focus on affordability and the evolution toward digital solutions. We also continue to be well-positioned to build market share, as more schools turn to outsourced bookstore operations. Our acquisition of MBS Textbook Exchange, LLC (“MBS”), also announced today, will accelerate our strategy, enabling us to generate more value from the textbook marketplace, increase our addressable market for bookstores and expand revenue opportunities for our digital courseware and analytics. With MBS, we are better positioned to broaden our reach and deepen our institutional partnerships through our ability to provide unmatched access to a comprehensive suite of flexible and affordable learning solutions.” Third Quarter 2017 Results Results for the 13 and 39 weeks of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 are as follows: $ in millions &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 and 39 Weeks Selected Data (unaudited) 13 Weeks &nbsp; 13 Weeks &nbsp; 39 Weeks &nbsp; 39 Weeks Q3 2017 Q3 2016 2017 2016 Total Sales $521.6 $518.4 $1,531.5 $1,513.3 Net Income(Loss) $3.8 $(3.6) $5.1 $2.9 &nbsp; Non-GAAP ((1)) Adjusted EBITDA $18.8 $24.2 $52.7 $61.7 Adjusted Earnings $ 4.0 $ 5.8 $7.8 $12.3 &nbsp; (1) These non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled in the attached schedules to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as required under SEC rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. &nbsp; Third quarter sales of $521.6 million increased $3.2 million, or 0.6%, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was attributable to new store growth partially offset by lower comparable store sales. Third quarter net income was $3.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $(3.6) million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, in the prior year period. The current year’s fiscal quarter has 46.8 million diluted shares outstanding, while the prior year period had 48.1 million diluted shares outstanding. The Company reported non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings of $4.0 million during the quarter, compared with $5.8 million in the prior year period. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA was $18.8 million for the quarter, as compared to $24.2 million in the prior year period, due primarily to lower comparable store sales. Outlook For fiscal year 2017, the Company expects total sales to grow by approximately 2.5%, while comparable store sales are expected to decrease by approximately 3.0% compared to the prior year. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to increase on a percentage basis in the mid-single digits compared with the prior year and expects capital expenditures to be approximately $40 million.

EXPLANATORY NOTE On February&nbsp;26, 2015, Barnes&nbsp;&amp; Noble, Inc. (“Barnes &amp; Noble”) announced plans for the complete legal and structural separation of Barnes &amp; Noble Education, Inc. (the “Company”) from Barnes&nbsp;&amp; Noble (the “Spin-Off”). Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Barnes &amp; Noble and the Company, Barnes&nbsp;&amp; Noble distributed all of its equity interest in the Company, consisting of all of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, to Barnes&nbsp;&amp; Noble’s stockholders on a pro rata basis. On July 14, 2015, Barnes &amp; Noble approved the final distribution ratio and declared a pro rata dividend of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (""Common Stock""), to Barnes &amp; Noble’s existing stockholders. The pro rata dividend was made on August 2, 2015 to the Barnes &amp; Noble stockholders of record (as of July 27, 2015). Each Barnes &amp; Noble stockholder of record received a distribution of 0.632 shares of the Company's Common Stock for each share of Barnes &amp; Noble common stock held on the record date. Following the Spin-Off, Barnes&nbsp;&amp; Noble does not own any equity interest in the Company. On August 2, 2015, the Company completed the legal separation from Barnes &amp; Noble, at which time the Company began to operate as an independent publicly-traded company. The Company's Common Stock began to trade on a “when-issued” basis on the NYSE under the symbol “BNED WI” beginning on July 23, 2015. On August 3, 2015, when-issued trading of the Company's Common Stock ended, the Company's Common Stock began “regular-way” trading under the symbol “BNED.” The results of operations for the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2015 reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a stand-alone basis since the Company was still part of Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc. until the consummation of the Spin-Off on August 2, 2015, and the results of operations for the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 28, 2017 and the 26 weeks ended January 30, 2016 reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis as the Company became a separate consolidated entity. &nbsp; BARNES&nbsp;&amp; NOBLE EDUCATION, INC.

Prior to the third quarter of Fiscal 2017, transactions costs were included in selling and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. &nbsp; (b) In Fiscal 2016, we implemented a plan to restructure our digital operations. As a result of this restructuring, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss totaling $12 million ($8.5 million net of tax benefit), related to all of the capitalized content costs for the Yuzu® eTextbook platform ($9 million), and recorded a non-recurring other than temporary loss related to an investment held at cost ($3 million) during the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 30, 2016. &nbsp; Additionally, we announced a reduction in staff and closure of the facilities in Mountain View, California, and Redmond, Washington, that support the Yuzu® eTextbook platform. We recorded restructuring costs of $8.8 million in Fiscal 2016 comprised of employee-related costs (including severance and retention) and facility exit costs. During the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2017, we recorded $1.8 million in additional restructuring costs primarily for employee related costs (including severance and retention). The majority of the restructuring related to employee matters was completed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. &nbsp; (c) The amounts shown represent the projected reduction in income tax expense based on the Company's current combined federal and state aggregate income tax rate. &nbsp; Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information - Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA &nbsp; To supplement the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), in the Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Earnings (defined as Net Income adjusted for certain reconciling items) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined by the Company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for additional items subtracted from or added to net income). &nbsp; These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company's use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of the Company's performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. &nbsp; The Company's management reviews these Non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate the Company's performance and manage the Company's operations. The Company's management believes that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by the Company to facilitate a comparison of on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. The Company's management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as it excludes certain items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of its operations. The Company's Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. The Company's management believes that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings results provides investors useful and important information regarding the Company's operating results. &nbsp; The non-GAAP measures included in the Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 has been reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures as required under Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. All of the items included in the reconciliations below are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing the Company's on-going operating performance. The Company urges investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of the Company’s Form 10-K dated April 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on June 29, 2016, which includes consolidated financial statements for each of the three years for the period ended April 30, 2016 (Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015, and Fiscal 2014), the quarterly earnings release for the period ended July 30, 2016 included as part of the Company's Form 8-K dated September 8, 2016 and filed with the SEC on that date, and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 29, 2016 filed with the SEC on December 6, 2016.

In addition, we will increase our addressable market to include the growing virtual bookstore market, and will now be able to offer our campus partners physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models. Our ability to leverage our expanded customer reach and distribution channels gives us the opportunity to immediately accelerate our strategy and provide scale benefits, an enhanced competitive advantage in the rapidly changing higher education industry.” For the MBS fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, MBS generated revenue of approximately $499.8 million and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) of approximately $54.7 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 million.1 Transaction Benefits Management believes the transaction will enhance BNED’s competitive positioning in the dynamic higher education industry as follows: Enhances ability to customize physical, virtual and hybrid models to meet customer needs: MBS’s advanced capabilities will enable BNED to expand its addressable market to include higher education institutions and K-12 schools that need virtual bookstore solutions -- a growing market segment with increasing demand and a key element of BNED’s competitive strategy. Together, BNED and MBS can offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and hybrid bookstore models, and can enhance MBS’s existing virtual bookstore offering, including using Promoversity, a custom merchandise supplier and storefront solution. Enables BNED to generate more value from the textbook marketplace: MBS’s wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems will enable BNED to optimize its textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes. With MBS, BNED will be able to more efficiently source and distribute a comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers with the highest and greatest need. Expands customer base for digital courseware and analytics: BNED will have new sales opportunities for its suite of digital course materials and platforms with MBS’s wholesale and virtual bookstore customers. The expanded combined customer base will broaden BNED’s reach and deepen its institutional partnerships through its ability to provide unmatched access to affordable solutions. Delivers significant financial benefits: The transaction is expected to be accretive to EBITDA, net income and cash flow in Fiscal 2018 and is expected to deliver operational synergies over time. BNED believes the compelling financial benefits, including increased cash flow generation, new revenue opportunities and operational synergies will help deliver significant shareholder value. Importantly, increased scale and cash flow generation will provide BNED with the flexibility to pursue additional growth opportunities in the rapidly changing higher education industry. “We are excited to join a company that shares our commitment to serving the education marketplace and driving student success,” said Bob Pugh, Chief Executive Officer, MBS. “We are confident that joining forces with Barnes &amp; Noble Education will enable us to serve the needs of our customers and partners even more effectively and better meet the demands of the changing education landscape. We look forward to being a member of the Barnes &amp; Noble Education family.” Transaction Details Prior to the acquisition, MBS was privately-held and majority-owned by affiliates of Leonard Riggio, who also owns approximately 16% of BNED’s outstanding shares. The BNED Board of Directors established a Special Committee of the Board, comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors, to evaluate the MBS acquisition opportunity, negotiate the terms, and make a recommendation to the BNED Board of Directors. The Special Committee retained independent financial and legal advisors. Both the Special Committee and the full BNED Board of Directors approved the transaction unanimously. The transaction closed on February 27, 2017. David Henderson has been named President of MBS and will report to Patrick Maloney, Chief Operating Officer, Barnes &amp; Noble Education, and President, Barnes &amp; Noble College. Bob Pugh, CEO of MBS, and Dan Schuppan, President of MBS, have announced their plans to retire as of March 31, 2017. Concurrent with the signing of the definitive acquisition agreement, BNED amended its credit facility to add a $100 million seasonal provision, increasing the maximum availability under the facility to $500 million, and borrowed approximately $55 million under the facility to fund the acquisition. BNED expects borrowings under the facility to vary from $0 to $250 million, reflecting seasonality in the business over the next twelve months. BNED expects to adjust the tax basis of MBS’s assets to their fair market values, which is anticipated to result in significant future cash tax savings.

Subsequent to quarter-end, declared a first quarter 2017 common share dividend of $0.375 per share. Summary Gramercy Property Trust (NYSE:GPT) today reported net income to common shareholders of $4.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, for the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, and net income to common shareholders of $27.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share for the full year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 includes $3.5 million of other income attributable to the reversal of an accrual for a tenant audit which was settled for a lower amount than originally estimated. Net income was reduced by $2.7 million, of which $10.1 million is reported as impairment of real estate investments, and is offset by gains of $5.5 million in equity of net income (loss) of unconsolidated investments, $409 thousand of gains in discontinued operations, and $1.5 million of net gains on disposals. For the quarter, the Company generated NAREIT defined FFO of $69.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted common share, and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, FFO was $274.5 million, or $1.93 per diluted common share. The Company also reported Core FFO of $72.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share during the quarter, and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, Core FFO was $314.4 million, or $2.21 per diluted common share. The Company generated adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, of $68.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted common share during the quarter,&nbsp;and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, AFFO was $288.6 million, or $2.03 per diluted common share.

For the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized total revenues of $126.2 million compared to $131.1 million reported in the prior quarter. The decrease of $4.9 million, or 3.7%, is primarily attributable to $4.5 million of additional amortization of below market lease intangibles in the third quarter of 2016. The Company reaffirms its previously announced outlook for 2017 with expected Core FFO of $2.10 - $2.25 per diluted common share and expected AFFO of $1.95 - $2.10 per diluted common share. This outlook assumes acquisition of properties of $400.0 million to $1.0 billion and disposition of properties of $200.0 million to $400.0 million and assumes zero to $400.0 million in equity raised. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company owned interests in 318 properties containing an aggregate of approximately 65.0 million rentable square feet with 98.5% occupancy and an ABR weighted average remaining lease term of 7.6 years.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to wind-up the asset management agreement with KBS at the end of the first quarter of 2017.

The decrease in fees of approximately $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 is primarily attributable to incremental incentive fees earned on the managed portfolio during the third quarter of 2016. Gramercy Asset Management recorded $1.0 million in incentive fees earned from the Company's third-party asset management business for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $2.9 million for the prior quarter.

On December 30, 2016, the Company completed a 1-for-3 reverse share split of the Company's common shares and its outstanding units of GPT Operating Partnership LP, resulting in the reduction of the outstanding common shares of beneficial interest from approximately 422.0 million to approximately 140.6 million.

General and administrative, or G&amp;A, expenses were $9.3 million for the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 compared to $8.2 million in the prior quarter.

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the mark-to-market on interest rate swaps was reclassified from AFFO to Core FFO and is included in Core FFO for all periods presented. &nbsp; 2. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a net loss available to common shareholders and therefore the diluted weighted average share calculation, which is the denominator in diluted earnings per share, excludes potentially dilutive securities because they would have been anti-dilutive during those periods. FFO for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was negative and therefore FFO per share for that period excludes all potentially dilutive securities. &nbsp; Disclaimers Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company has used non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G in this press release. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in this release. Funds from operations (“FFO”): The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to noncontrolling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Core FFO and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”): Core FFO and AFFO are presented excluding property acquisition costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, other-than-temporary impairments on retained bonds, mark-to-market on interest rate swaps, and one-time charges. AFFO of the Company also excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of above- and below-market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of lease inducement costs, non-real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of free rent received at property acquisition, straight-line rent, and these AFFO adjustments as they pertain to the Company's unconsolidated equity investments. The Company believes that Core FFO and AFFO are useful supplemental measures regarding the Company’s operating performances as they provide a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company’s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s operating results. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as indications of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity, nor are they entirely indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

The Company is presenting Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that it provides useful information to investors about HNH, its business, and its financial condition. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from continuing operations before the effects of gains or losses from investment in associated company, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, LIFO liquidation gains or losses, and non-cash pension expense, and excludes certain non-recurring and non-cash items. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the measures used by the Company's Board of Directors and management to evaluate its business, including in internal management reporting, budgeting, and forecasting processes, in comparing operating results across the business, as an internal profitability measure, as a component in evaluating the ability and the desirability of making capital expenditures and significant acquisitions, and as an element in determining executive compensation. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Because Adjusted EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including realized losses on derivatives, interest expense, and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business. There are a number of material limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool, including the following: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect gains or losses from the Company's investment in associated company; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and any LIFO liquidations of its precious metal inventory; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's interest expense; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's tax provision or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses in the period recorded, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash requirements for such replacement; Adjusted EBITDA does not include non-cash charges for pension expense and stock-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not include discontinued operations; and Adjusted EBITDA does not include certain other non-recurring and non-cash items. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its U.S. GAAP financial measures and by using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information. The Company believes that consideration of Adjusted EBITDA, together with a careful review of its U.S. GAAP financial measures, is the most informed method of analyzing HNH. The Company reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from continuing operations, net of tax, and that reconciliation is set forth above. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016.

Equity: Industrial Colony’s interest in the U.S. industrial portfolio (“Colony U.S. Industrial”) was an average 52% during the fourth quarter of 2016. With additional commitments drawn in the open-end fund during the fourth quarter of 2016, Colony’s interest in Colony U.S. Industrial is approximately 49% as of December 31, 2016. The Company continues to own a 100% interest in the related operating platform. Colony U.S. Industrial primarily invests in light industrial properties in infill locations in major U.S. metropolitan markets targeting multi-tenant buildings of up to 500,000 square feet and single tenant buildings of up to 250,000 square feet with an office buildout of less than 20%. As of December 31, 2016, Colony U.S. Industrial’s portfolio consisted of 346 primarily light industrial buildings totaling 37.6 million square feet across 15 major U.S. markets and was 96% leased. During the fourth quarter, Colony U.S. Industrial’s same store portfolio produced recurring revenue growth of 2.5% and net operating income growth of 9.1% over the same period last year and sequential quarter-over-quarter recurring revenue growth of 0.5% and net operating income growth of 0.6%. Colony U.S. Industrial’s same store portfolio is defined as buildings in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison and included 307 and 322 properties in the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons, respectively. During the fourth quarter 2016, this segment’s net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(5.2) million, while Core FFO was $12.2 million. On September 30, 2016, Colony held a closing for its first open-end fund, which invests in the U.S. industrial market and has received $311 million of third-party commitments to date representing a 22% interest in the Colony U.S. Industrial portfolio. The Company holds a 49% interest in Colony U.S. Industrial and other long-term third party capital represents the balance of ownership. Equity: Single Family Residential Rentals Colony’s investment in Single Family Residential Rentals included 15.1 million shares in Colony Starwood Homes (NYSE:SFR), which represents a 14.0% ownership based on the total common shares and OP units outstanding. Separately, Colony owned a $58 million share of the net book value in Colony American Finance, which represents a 17.4% ownership. As of December 31, 2016, Colony’s interest in SFR had a carrying value of $316 million. Based on SFR’s closing share price of $32.54 on February 24, 2017, the Company’s interest in SFR was valued at $492 million. During the fourth quarter 2016, this segment’s net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(0.5) million, while Core FFO was $8.6 million. Other Real Estate Equity Colony’s investment in Other Real Estate Equity included triple net lease investments, real estate acquired in settlement of loans, common equity in real estate or related companies, and preferred equity investments meeting certain risk and return profiles. During the fourth quarter 2016, this segment’s net income attributable to common stockholders was $11.9 million and Core FFO was $18.8 million. Real Estate Debt Colony’s investment in Real Estate Debt included originations and acquisitions of senior loans and subordinated debt, including preferred equity investments meeting certain risk and fixed return parameters.

AUM and FEEUM decreased primarily due to the investment realizations in legacy funds being in excess of both new capital commitments and an increase of the fair value of investments under management. For the fourth quarter 2016, this segment’s net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $3.6 million while Core FFO was $6.4 million.

Subsequent to the fourth quarter 2016, the Company completed the previously announced sale of an 18.7% preferred joint venture interest in its healthcare real estate portfolio, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $340 million, representing an implied 6.1% cap rate. Post-Merger: Colony NorthStar Update 2017 Updated Guidance The Company is updating its Core FFO guidance for the year ending 2017 to a range of $1.40 to $1.58 per share, but does not intend to provide updates to Core FFO guidance going forward. In comparison to the original 2017 guidance that was provided in the Investor Presentation related to the merger filed on June 7, 2016, the update includes lower earnings due primarily to: 1) less third party capital raising; 2) less cash available to deploy into investments resulting from the increase of the NSAM special dividend among other reasons; and, 3) accelerating the replacement of higher-yielding, non-core investments with lower-yielding investments that better fit the strategic direction of the Company. The updated 2017 guidance included in this press release is subject to the cautionary statements and limitations described in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section at the end of this press release. Common Stock Repurchase Program On February 23, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $300 million of its outstanding common stock through February 22, 2018.

Asset Monetizations The Company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its entire manufactured housing communities portfolio for $2.0 billion, which will result in net proceeds of approximately $615 million. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter 2017; however, there is no assurance this transaction will close on the terms anticipated, if at all. Liquidity, Financing and Capital Markets Concurrent with the closing of the merger, NSAM and NRF repaid in entirety their term loan borrowings of $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, and Colony NorthStar amended and restated Colony’s revolving credit facility increasing commitments from $850 million to $1.0 billion and renewing the initial term to four years with two 6-month extension options. As of February 24, 2017, the Company had a total of approximately $135 million of unrestricted cash, $500 million of undrawn capacity on its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and expects to receive $615 million of net proceeds from the sale of the manufactured housing communities portfolio. Stockholders’ Equity As of February 24, 2017, the Company had approximately 564.3 million Class A and B common stock and restricted stock units outstanding and the Company’s operating partnership had approximately 34.3 million operating company units outstanding held by members other than the Company or its subsidiaries. Assets Under Management (“AUM”) As of December 31, 2016 the Company had $56 billion of AUM, pro forma for NRF asset monetizations as of February 24, 2017: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (In billions) Amount % of Grand Total &nbsp; Balance Sheet (CLNS Pro Rata Share): Healthcare $ 3.9 7.0 % Industrial 1.2 2.1 % Hospitality 3.5 6.2 % Other Equity and Debt 6.5 &nbsp; 11.6 % Balance Sheet Subtotal 15.1 26.9 % &nbsp; Investment Management: Institutional Funds 11.0 19.6 % Retail Companies 6.8 12.1 % NorthStar Realty Europe (NYSE:NRE) 2.0 3.6 % Townsend 14.6 26.0 % Pro Rata Corporate Investments 6.6 &nbsp; 11.8 % Investment Management Subtotal 41.0 73.1 % &nbsp; &nbsp; Grand Total $ 56.1 &nbsp; 100.0 % &nbsp; Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions Colony Fee-Earning Equity Under Management (“FEEUM”) Colony Fee-Earning Equity Under Management refers to the equity for which Colony provided investment management services and from which it derived management fees and/or performance allocations. FEEUM is presented as of December 31, 2016, and included $0.3 billion of uncalled limited partner capital commitments which did not bear fees. Additionally, $0.3 billion pertained to FEEUM of Colony’s equity-method investment in a German-based asset management platform. Colony’s calculations of FEEUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Colony Assets Under Management Colony Assets Under Management refers to the assets for which Colony provided investment management services and included assets for which it may or may not charge management fees and/or performance allocations. AUM is presented as of December 31, 2016 and equaled the sum of: a) the gross fair value of investments held directly by Colony or managed by Colony on behalf of its private funds, co-investments, or other investment vehicles; b) leverage, inclusive of debt held by investments and deferred purchases prices; c) uncalled limited partner capital commitments which Colony was entitled to call from investors during the given commitment period at its discretion pursuant to the terms of their respective funds; and d) with respect to majority-owned and substantially controlled investments consolidated by Colony, gross assets attributable to third-party investors. Colony’s calculations of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. CLNS Assets Under Management Refers to assets which the Company and its affiliates provides investment management services, including assets for which the Company may or may not charge management fees and/or performance allocations. AUM is generally based on reported gross carrying value or cost basis of managed investments as reported by each underlying vehicle at December 31, 2016, proforma for NRF asset monetizations, while legacy NRF real estate assets are based on preliminary merger purchase price accounting figures and retail companies and NorthStar Realty Europe are presented as of February 24, 2017. AUM further includes a) uncalled capital commitments and b) for corporate investments in affiliates with asset and investment management functions, includes the Company’s pro-rata share assets of each affiliate as presented and calculated by the affiliate. Affiliates include RXR Realty LLC, SteelWave, LLC, American Healthcare Investors and Hamburg Trust. The Company's calculations of AUM may differ materially from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. NSAM Cash Available for Distribution (“CAD”) NSAM believed that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. NSAM Management also used CAD, among other measures, to evaluate profitability. In addition, the incentive fees to which NSAM was entitled to pursuant to its prior management agreements with each of its NorthStar Listed Companies were determined using such NorthStar Listed Company’s CAD as a performance metric. NSAM believed that CAD is useful because it adjusted for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other, realized gain (loss) on investments and other and asset impairment). NSAM adjusted for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of its operating performance. For instance, these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments or restructuring of investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions. NSAM calculated CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests attributable to NSAM’s Operating Partnership and the following items: equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization related items, amortization of deferred financing costs, foreign currency gains (losses), impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets, straight-line rent, adjustments for joint ventures and investment funds, unrealized (gain) loss from fair value adjustments, realized gain (loss) on investments and transaction and other costs. These items, if applicable, included any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures. NSAM management also believed that quarterly distributions were principally based on operating performance and its board of directors included CAD as one of several metrics it reviewed to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, NSAM’s methodology for calculating CAD involved subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. NRF Cash Available for Distribution NRF believed that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. NRF also believed that CAD was useful because it adjusted for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, N-Star CDO equity interests, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, realized gain (loss) on investments, provision for loan losses, asset impairment, non-recurring bad debt expense and certain interest income and expense items). NRF adjusted for transaction costs because these costs were not a meaningful indicator of its operating performance. For instance, these transaction costs included costs such as professional fees associated with new investments or restructuring of investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions. NRF adjusted for N-Star CDO equity interests to represent the net economic interest generated from the N-Star CDO equity interests. This adjustment was a component of NRF’s ongoing return on such investments, and therefore, was adjusted in CAD as it provided investors and management with a meaningful indicator of NRF’s operating performance. Furthermore, CAD adjusted N-Star CDO bond discounts to record such investments on an effective yield basis over the expected weighted average life of the investment. N-Star CDO bond discounts related to repurchased CDO bonds of consolidated CDO financing transactions at a discount to par. These CDO bonds typically have a low interest rate and the majority of the return was generated from repurchasing the CDO bonds at a discount to expected recovery value. Because the return generated through the accretion of the discount was a meaningful contributor to NRF’s operating performance, such accretion was adjusted in CAD. The computation for the accretion of the discount under U.S. GAAP and CAD was the same. However, for CDO financing transactions that are consolidated under U.S. GAAP, the CDO bonds were not presented as an investment but rather were eliminated in NRF’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, NRF adjusted for distributions and adjustments to joint venture partners, which represented the net return generated from NRF investments allocated to our non-controlling interests. For NRF’s owned hotels, NRF’s CAD calculation did not make an adjustment for furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&amp;E) reserves. CAD fluctuated from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and amount of investments, repayments and asset sales, capital raised, use of leverage, changes in the expected yield of investments and the overall conditions in commercial real estate and the economy generally. Management also believed that quarterly distributions were principally based on operating performance and NRF’s board of directors included CAD as one of several metrics it reviewed to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. NRF calculated CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests and the following items: depreciation and amortization items including straight-line rental income or expense, amortization of above/below market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of discount on financings and other and equity-based compensation; net economic interest generated from N-Star CDO equity interests; accretion of consolidated N-Star CDO bond discounts; net interest income in consolidated N-Star CDOs; unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value; realized gain (loss) on investments and other, excluding accelerated amortization related to sales of CDO bonds or other investments; provision for loan losses, net; impairment on depreciable property; non-recurring bad debt expense; acquisition gains or losses; distributions and adjustments related to joint venture partners; transaction costs; foreign currency gains (losses); impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets; and one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items. CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, NRF’s methodology for calculating CAD involved subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Colony Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) Colony calculated funds from operations (""FFO"") in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Included in FFO are gains and losses from sales of assets which are not depreciable real estate such as loans receivable, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as well as investments in debt and other equity securities, as applicable. Colony computed core funds from operations (""Core FFO"") by adjusting FFO for the following items, including Colony’s share of these items recognized by its unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures: (i) gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, net of depreciation, amortization and impairment previously adjusted for FFO; (ii) stock compensation expense; (iii) effects of straight-line rent revenue and straight-line rent expense on ground leases; (iv) amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease values; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts; (vi) unrealized fair value gains or losses on derivative instruments and on foreign currency remeasurements; (vii) acquisition-related expenses, merger and integration costs; (viii) amortization and impairment of finite-lived intangibles related to investment management contracts and customer relationships; (ix) gain on remeasurement of consolidated investment entities and the effect of amortization thereof; (x) non-real estate depreciation and amortization; (xi) change in fair value of contingent consideration; and (xii) deferred tax effect on the foregoing adjustments. Also, beginning with the first quarter of 2016, Colony’s share of Core FFO from its interest in Colony Starwood Homes (NYSE: SFR) represented its percentage interest multiplied by SFR's reported Core FFO, which may differ from Colony’s calculation of Core FFO. Refer to SFR's filings for its definition and calculation of Core FFO. FFO and Core FFO should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income as indications of operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity, nor as indications of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions. FFO and Core FFO should not be used as supplements to or substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Colony’s calculations of FFO and Core FFO may differ from methodologies utilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs. Colony used FFO and Core FFO as supplemental performance measures because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs. Colony also believed that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs, FFO and Core FFO would be used by investors as a basis to compare its operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO and Core FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of Colony’s properties that resulted from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of its properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact Colony’s results from operations, the utility of FFO and Core FFO as measures of Colony’s performance was limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO and Core FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, Colony’s FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO and Core FFO. Accordingly, FFO and Core FFO should be considered only as supplements to net income as a measure of Colony’s performance. NRF Net Operating Income (“NOI”) NRF believed NOI was a useful metric of the operating performance of its real estate portfolio in the aggregate. Portfolio results and performance metrics represented 100% for all consolidated investments and represented NRF’s ownership percentage for unconsolidated joint ventures. Net operating income represented total property and related revenues, adjusted for: (i) amortization of above/below market rent; (ii) straight line rent; (iii) other items such as adjustments related to joint ventures and non-recurring bad debt expense; and (iv) less property operating expenses. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excluded general and administrative costs, interest expense, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization expense, realized gains (losses) from the sale of properties and other items under U.S. GAAP and capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of properties, all of which may be significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, NRF’s methodology for calculating NOI involved subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.

The company is showcasing live demonstrations of these solutions in booth #1629 at TechAdvantage 2017, being held at the San Diego Convention Center from February 26 – March 1, 2017. .@TantalusCorp demonstrating the power of intelligent #DataAnalytics in edge devices during @TechAdvantage1Tweet this TUNet is anchored by a network of intelligent edge computing modules integrated into a broad range of smart grid end points such as meters and Distribution Automation (DA) devices. Each TUNet module uses a Linux-based computing platform to collect and analyze data, make intelligent decisions and report by exception to the utility’s central servers. TUNet’s efficient use of its Utility IoT architecture enables the utility to leverage its smart grid network more effectively while ensuring that operators receive precisely the right data at the right time and from the right location to make more informed decisions. “Tantalus’ ability to rapidly deliver and support new applications such as smart street lighting has made a significant impact on our ability to build a self-sustaining smart grid,” stated Clinton Hedrington, COO for the Virgin Islands Water &amp; Power Authority (VIWAPA). “The ability to quickly and cost-effectively propagate TUNet to remote areas of our islands while simultaneously supporting sophisticated lighting control programs has been beneficial. We expect to save up to 30% in operating costs through the efficiencies of networked smart street lights. The addition of this application will also improve safety and satisfaction for our residents.” Another smart grid solution now deployed throughout Tantalus’ customer base is Distribution Grid Optimization. Applications such as CVR and VO are enhanced by leveraging TUNet’s distributed intelligence and communications for improved performance. Tantalus delivers this by combining its Closed Loop Voltage Reduction (CLVR™) feature with its TUNet DA Bridge Modem, providing a near real-time meter voltage monitoring and alerting application with a modem that supports DNP3 data delivery across TUNet. This extends visibility and control from the SCADA system to end-of-line DA devices such as capacitor bank controllers and voltage regulators while capturing FCI data and alerts in near real-time. This combined functionality helps utilities maximize value from their TUNet AMI network investments. “Since partnering with Tantalus, our cooperative has been able to make the most of our technology investments to improve reliability and service for our members,” remarked Terry Rosenthal, Manager of Engineering for Laclede Electric Cooperative in Missouri. “We are benefitting from Tantalus’ approach to engage customers in developing the applications that meet our needs. With the ability to monitor and control grid performance at the edge of our distribution network, we’ve significantly enhanced operations and lowered outage restoration times.” “We remain committed to serving the needs of municipal and cooperative utilities,” said Peter Londa, President &amp; CEO for Tantalus. “Our recent financing will enable us to accelerate the delivery of integrated applications such as street light control and grid optimization to progressive utilities such as VIWAPA and Laclede EC. We are excited to expand our product portfolio and go beyond AMI for the benefit of our User Community.” About Tantalus Tantalus provides a two-way, multi-purpose platform that enables access to data to power advanced Smart Grid applications for monitoring and control of electric, water and gas municipal and cooperative utilities. TUNet® – the Tantalus Utility Network – is an award winning flexible end-to-end WAN/FAN/LAN/Grid Edge communications system. TUNet is purpose built for the Smart Grid and unites utility applications through a software-defined radio (SDR) and distributed computing capability embedded at every endpoint. The result is enhanced value across all utility departments through solutions such as automated metering, outage management, power quality monitoring, load management, distribution automation and grid optimization that are both cost-effective and practical to deploy throughout urban and rural service areas.

Company highlights for the fourth quarter and full year include: “The focused execution of our clear and differentiated real-estate strategy yielded solid results in the fourth quarter, including increases in revenue, occupancy, average monthly rent, EBITDAR and CFFO, as compared to the previous quarter”Tweet this Operating and Financial Summary (all amounts in this operating and financial summary exclude three communities that are undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, unless otherwise noted; also, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below and reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure on the final page of this release.) Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016, including all communities, was $115.8 million, an $8.3 million, or 7.7%, increase from the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue for full year 2016 increased $35.3 million, or 8.6% to $447.4 million. Revenue for consolidated communities, which excludes the three communities undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, was $111.3 million in fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For full year 2016, revenue for consolidated communities was $429.7 million, a 9.0% increase as compared to full year 2015. Occupancy for the Company’s consolidated communities was 88.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 and a decrease of 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015. Same-community occupancy was 88.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 10 basis point decrease from the third quarter of 2016 and a 60 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015. Average monthly rent for the Company’s consolidated communities in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $3,512, an increase of $76 per occupied unit, or 2.2%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

Excluding non-recurring or non-economic items, the Company’s adjusted net loss was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $3.9 million for full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDAR was $38.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 1.1% increase from the fourth quarter of 2015.

On January 31, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of four communities that it previously leased for a total purchase price of approximately $85 million. This transaction results in incremental annual CFFO of approximately $2.0 million. “The focused execution of our clear and differentiated real-estate strategy yielded solid results in the fourth quarter, including increases in revenue, occupancy, average monthly rent, EBITDAR and CFFO, as compared to the previous quarter,” said Lawrence A. Cohen, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Attrition and healthcare claims, which were unusually high in the third quarter, returned to more normal levels in the fourth quarter, and we continue to be well insulated from competitive new supply and wage pressure in most of our markets. We also continued to increase our real estate ownership with the acquisition of one community in the fourth quarter and the closing of a strategic purchase of four communities we previously leased in January. “As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, we expect the continued execution of our strategic business plan to produce outstanding growth in all of our key metrics. In addition to core growth in our operations, our growth will be enhanced by the significant renovations we have made across our portfolio and even greater by the return of a significant number of units currently out of service due to conversions and repositionings. And, we have a robust acquisition pipeline that will allow us to continue to increase our ownership of high-quality senior housing communities in geographically concentrated regions. As such, we believe that we are well positioned to create long-term shareholder value as a larger company with scale, competitive advantages and a substantially all private-pay business model in a highly-fragmented industry that benefits from long-term demographics, need-driven demand, limited competitive new supply in our local markets, a strong housing market and a growing economy.” Recent Investment Activity As previously reported, the Company completed the acquisition of one senior housing community for a purchase price of approximately $29.0 million in early November. This community expands the Company’s operations in Ohio and is comprised of 122 units offering independent living, assisted living and memory care services. | | Highlights of this transaction were previously reported in the third quarter earnings release in combination with two third quarter acquisitions and are shown below for this individual transaction: Increases annual Adjusted CFFO by approximately $1.1 million. Adds approximately $0.4 million to earnings. Increases annual revenue by approximately $6.4 million. Average monthly rent for the community is approximately $4,500. The community was financed with approximately $22.0 million of non-recourse mortgage debt with a term of 10 years at a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.2%. The Company completed acquisitions of four senior housing communities that it previously leased for a combined purchase price of approximately $85.0 million in January 2017. As the communities were previously leased, there is no increase to revenue or EBITDAR related to the transaction; however, the replacement of high cost lease expense, and subsequent annual escalators, with attractive debt financing results in an initial annual increase in Adjusted CFFO and earnings of approximately $2.0 million. | | The communities were financed with a 36-month, interest-only bridge loan for $65.0 million with an initial variable interest rate of approximately 4.8%. Three of the four communities are currently undergoing renovation and conversion. The Company plans to obtain permanent financing based on the enhanced cash flow of the communities once the renovations and conversions are completed and occupancy reaches stabilization. | | Highlights of this transaction include: Replaces $5.1 million of high cost rent expense with attractive debt financing, resulting in $2.0 million initial annual incremental savings Eliminates annual 3% minimum rent escalators Increases the Company’s owned real estate to 83 owned communities or 64.3% Provides greater flexibility related to renovation or conversion opportunities and enhancement of real estate and shareholder value due to ownership of real estate The Company has a strong pipeline of near- to medium-term targets and is conducting due diligence on additional acquisitions of high-quality senior housing communities in states with extensive existing operations. With a strong reputation among sellers, the Company sources the majority of its acquisitions off-market and at attractive terms. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company completed supplemental loans on four communities that resulted in $15.6 million in net cash proceeds, which recognizes the significant value that has been created in these communities since the date of their primary loans in 2014 and 2015. These loans have an average interest rate of 5.7% and mature coterminous with the original loans in 2024 through 2026. Financial Results – Fourth Quarter For the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reported revenue of $115.8 million, compared to revenue of $107.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 7.7%, mostly due to the acquisition of nine communities during or since the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue for consolidated communities excluding the three communities undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion increased 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $71.8 million, an increase of $6.7 million from the fourth quarter of 2015, also primarily due to the acquisitions of senior housing communities made during or since the fourth quarter of 2015. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $6.7 million, which includes approximately $1.1 million in one-time costs associated with the passing of Keith Johannessen, the Company’s former President and Chief Operating Officer. This compares to general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding one-time, transaction and conversion costs of approximately $2.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and transaction and conversion costs of $0.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. As a percentage of revenues under management, general and administrative expenses, excluding one-time, transaction and conversion costs, were 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.8 million. The Company recorded a net loss on a GAAP basis of $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding non-recurring or non-economic items reconciled on the final page of this release, the Company’s adjusted net loss was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures exclude three communities that are undergoing repositioning, lease-up of higher-licensed units or significant renovation and conversion (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below). Adjusted EBITDAR for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $38.6 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 1.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The three communities undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, not included in Adjusted EBITDAR, generated an additional $0.7 million of EBITDAR. Adjusted CFFO was $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Financial Results – Full Year The Company reported 2016 revenue of $447.4 million, compared to revenue of $412.2 million in 2015, an increase of 8.6%. Revenue for consolidated communities excluding the three communities undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion increased 9.0% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Operating expenses were $273.9 million in 2016, an increase of $25.2 million from 2015. General and administrative expenses were $23.7 million in 2016 compared to $20.4 million in 2015. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues under management, excluding one-time, transaction and conversion costs, were 4.4% in 2016 compared to 4.3% in 2015. Income from operations for full year 2016 was $14.4 million. The Company recorded a net loss on a GAAP basis of $28.0 million for full year 2016. Excluding non-recurring or non-economic items reconciled on the final page of this release, the Company’s adjusted net loss was $3.9 million for full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDAR was $152.9 million for full year 2016, an increase of $8.4 million, or 5.8%, compared to full year 2015. The three communities undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, not included in Adjusted EBITDAR, generated an additional $3.2 million of EBITDAR in 2016. Adjusted CFFO for 2016 was $48.3 million in 2016, as compared to $47.0 million in 2015. Operating Activities Same-community results exclude the three communities previously noted that are undergoing repositioning, lease-up or significant renovation and conversion, and transaction and other one-time costs. Same-community revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Due to conversion and refurbishment projects currently in progress at certain communities, fewer units were available for rent in the fourth quarter of this year than the fourth quarter of last year. Same-community expenses increased 1.6% from the fourth quarter of the prior year, excluding conversion costs in both periods. On the same basis, labor costs, including benefits, increased 2.1%, food costs decreased 3.8% and utilities increased 3.3%, all as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, and same-community net operating income decreased 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $15.1 million, representing approximately $13.6 million of investment spending and approximately $1.5 million of recurring capital expenditures. Spending in 2016 for recurring capital expenditures equaled $5.5 million, or approximately $450 per unit. Balance Sheet The Company ended the quarter with $47.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company received net cash proceeds of $15.6 million related to supplemental loans for four communities, invested $7.0 million in a community acquired during the fourth quarter, and spent $15.1 million on capital improvements. The Company received reimbursements totaling $1.7 million in the fourth quarter for capital improvements and expects to receive additional reimbursements as the remaining projects are completed. As of December 31, 2016, the Company financed its owned communities with mortgages totaling $907.2 million at interest rates averaging 4.6%. All of the Company’s debt is at fixed interest rates, except for one bridge loan totaling approximately $11.8 million at December 31, 2016, which matures in the fourth quarter of 2018. The earliest maturity date for the Company’s fixed-rate debt is in 2021. The Company’s cash on hand and cash flow from operations are expected to be sufficient for working capital, prudent reserves and the equity needed to fund the Company’s acquisition, conversion and renovation programs.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures of Operating Performance Adjusted EBITDAR is a financial valuation measure and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted CFFO are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAR is a valuation measure commonly used by our management, research analysts and investors to value companies in the senior living industry. Because Adjusted EBITDAR excludes interest expense and rent expense, it allows our management, research analysts and investors to compare the enterprise values of different companies without regard to differences in capital structures and leasing arrangements. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted CFFO are useful as performance measures in identifying trends in day-to-day operations because they exclude the costs associated with acquisitions and conversions and other items that do not ordinarily reflect the ongoing operating results of our primary business. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted CFFO provide indicators to management of progress in achieving both consolidated and individual business unit operating performance and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance of companies in the senior living industry. The Company strongly urges you to review on the last page of this release the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDAR and the reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted CFFO, along with the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, and statements of cash flows.

Safe Harbor The forward-looking statements in this release are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially, including, but not without limitation to, the Company’s ability to find suitable acquisition properties at favorable terms, financing, refinancing, community sales, licensing, business conditions, risks of downturns in economic conditions generally, satisfaction of closing conditions such as those pertaining to licensure, availability of insurance at commercially reasonable rates, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations among others, and other risks and factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Signed new leases totaling 2.1 million square feet at an average annual base rent of $17.68 PSF, including 891,000 square feet at $16.72 PSF in the fourth quarter. Achieved releasing spreads of 4.4x on new leases signed for space currently or formerly occupied by Sears Holdings Corporation (“Sears Holdings”), with new rents averaging $17.86 PSF compared to $4.03 PSF paid by Sears Holdings across 1.9 million square feet on a same-space basis. Increased annual base rent attributable to third-party tenants to 36.1% compared to 24.0% as of December 31, 2015, including all signed leases and net of rent attributable to the associated space to be recaptured. Announced 28 new redevelopment projects with a total projected cost of $335.0 million and completed six previously announced projects with a total cost of approximately $36.5 million. “In just 18 months, we have established Seritage as one of the most active developers of retail real estate in the country with 48 projects, representing a total investment of over $460 million, completed or commenced,” said Benjamin Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer. “For the 33 projects we’ve initiated fully on our platform, we are expecting incremental returns in excess of 12% on an unlevered basis, and project stabilized income of almost $70 million, an increase of over 330% versus in-place income. And once completed, more than 90% of the income from these 33 projects will be derived from a diverse group of growing retailers, and less than 10% from Sears Holdings. As we look to 2017, we have a strong pipeline of leasing and redevelopment activity that we’re focused on executing, and expect to realize rental spreads and returns on capital for that pipeline that are consistent with those that we’ve achieved thus far. We continue to see strong demand for our well-located properties from a range of growing retailers, and are energized to build off our momentum as we diversify our tenant base, grow net operating income and create value for our shareholders.” Financial Results For the three months ended December 31, 2016, net loss attributable to Class A and Class C shareholders was $15.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $4.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net loss attributable to Class A and Class C shareholders was $51.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, Total NOI, which includes the Company’s proportional share of NOI from 31 properties owned through investments in its unconsolidated JVs, was $48.7 million as compared to $47.0 million for the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Total NOI was $190.5 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, FFO, as calculated in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, was $34.5 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, as compared to $31.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, FFO was $106.5 million, or $1.92 per diluted share. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, Company FFO was $30.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, as compared to $32.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Company FFO was $127.3 million, or $2.29 per diluted share. The Company makes certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Company FFO, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized gain or loss on interest rate cap, litigation charges, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of deferred financing costs and certain up-front-hiring and personnel costs, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results. The Company previously referred to this metric as Normalized FFO; the definition and calculation remain the same. Portfolio Summary As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio included interests in 266 retail properties totaling over 42 million square feet of gross leasable area, including 235 wholly-owned properties and 31 properties owned through investments in unconsolidated JVs. Approximately 50% of the portfolio consisted of properties attached to regional malls and approximately 50% consisted of shopping center or freestanding properties. The portfolio was 99.2% leased and included 15 properties leased only to third-party tenants, 125 properties leased to Sears Holdings and one or more third-party tenants, and 126 properties leased only to Sears Holdings. Of the properties leased to Sears Holdings, 169 operated under the Sears brand and 82 operated under the Kmart brand. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, Sears Holdings vacated 17 Kmart stores pursuant to termination notices previously submitted to the Company (see “Sears Holdings Terminations under the Master Lease”). Including the effect of the terminations, the portfolio was 95.5% leased. Development Update Wholly-Owned Properties During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company commenced 28 projects representing an estimated total investment of $335.0 million, including eight new projects representing an estimated total investment of $112.7 million in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s wholly-owned development pipeline consisted primarily of 33 projects originated on the Seritage platform. These projects represent an estimated total investment of $399.1&nbsp;million, of which $353.9 million remained to be spent. An additional two projects with a total investment of $5.1 million, of which $3.8 million remained to be spent, were acquired by the Company as part of the initial acquisition of its portfolio.

(the “Simon JV”). This opening represents the substantial completion of the third of four JV projects that were in various stages of development when they were acquired by the Company in July 2015. Earlier in 2016, Primark opened at Danbury Fair Mall and Freehold Raceway Mall in stores owned by the Company’s unconsolidated JV with The Macerich Company (the “Macerich JV”), and, at Staten Island Mall, a Primark store owned by the Company’s unconsolidated JV with GGP Inc. (the “GGP JV”), is under construction. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the GGP JV announced plans to recapture space at five locations according to a specific schedule, including Oakbrook Center in Oak Brook, IL, The Mall at Columbia in Columbia, MD, Natick Collection in Natick, MA, Paramus Park in Paramus, NJ and Alderwood in Lynnwood, WA. The GGP JV will recapture 100% of the space currently occupied by Sears Holdings at Alderwood and Paramus Park, while Sears Holdings will continue to occupy a downsized space at the other locations. As of December 31, 2016, the GGP JV has initiated redevelopment projects at four additional properties, including Staten Island Mall in Staten Island, NY, Coronado Mall in Albuquerque, NM, Pembroke Lakes Mall in Pembroke Pines, FL, and Valley Plaza Mall in Bakersfield, CA. Leasing Update During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company signed new leases totaling 2.1 million square feet at an average annual base rent of $17.68 PSF, including 891,000 square feet at $16.72 PSF in the fourth quarter. On a same-space basis, new rents were 4.4x higher than prior rents for space currently or formerly occupied by Sears Holdings, increasing to $17.86 PSF for new tenants compared to $4.03 PSF paid by Sears Holdings across 1.9 million square feet.

The aggregate annual base rent at these stores was approximately $6.0 million, or 2.6% of the Company's total annual base rent as of December 31, 2016, including all signed leases. In connection with the termination, Sears Holdings paid Seritage a termination fee of approximately $10.0 million, an amount equal to one year of the aggregate annual base rent and estimated operating expenses for the 17 properties. Also on January 3, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease between subsidiaries of the Company and subsidiaries of Sears Holdings, Sears Holdings provided notice that it intends to exercise its right to terminate the Master Lease with respect to 19 additional stores totaling 1.9 million square feet of gross leasable area. The aggregate annual base rent at these stores is approximately $5.9 million, or 2.5% of the Company's total annual base rent as of December 31, 2016, including all signed leases. Sears Holdings will continue to pay Seritage rent until it vacates the stores which is expected to occur in April 2017. Pursuant to the Master Lease, Sears Holdings will also pay Seritage a termination fee equal to one year of the aggregate annual base rent and estimated operating expenses for the 19 properties. Balance Sheet and Liquidity As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s total market capitalization was $3.6 billion. Total market capitalization is calculated as the sum of total debt and the market value of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, assuming conversion of operating partnership units. Total debt to total market capitalization was 33.1% and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 5.6x. The Company deducts both unrestricted and restricted cash from total debt when calculating net debt. Reconciliations of net loss attributable to common shareholders to EBITDA, and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, are provided in the tables accompanying this press release. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had $52.0 million of unrestricted cash and restricted cash of $87.6 million, the substantial majority of which is held in reserve accounts for redevelopment, re-leasing and operating expenses at the Company’s properties. The Company also had approximately $80.0 million of investment capital available through its $100.0 million future funding facility, of which approximately $20.0 million was drawn as of December 31, 2016. Mortgage Loan Amendment In November 2016, the Company and the servicer for its existing mortgage loan facility entered into an amendment to resolve a disagreement regarding one of the cash flow sweep provisions in the loan agreements. The principal terms of the amendment are that the Company has (i) posted $30.0 million, and will post $3.3 million on a monthly basis, to a redevelopment reserve account, which amounts may be used by the Company to fund redevelopment projects and (ii) extended the spread maintenance provision for prepayment of the loan by two months through March 9, 2018 (with the spread maintenance premium for the second month at a reduced amount). As a result of this amendment and the resolution of the related disagreement, no cash flow sweep was imposed. Unsecured Term Loan Facility In February 2017, the Company entered into a $200.0 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “Facility”) with entities controlled by ESL Investments, Inc. Edward S. Lampert, the Company’s Chairman, is the sole stockholder, chief executive officer and director of ESL Investments, Inc. The Company expects to use the proceeds of the Facility to fund redevelopment projects and for general corporate purposes. The total commitments under the Facility are $200.0 million, provided that the maximum draw amount under the Facility through April 30, 2017 is $100.0 million, which amount increases to $150.0 million on May 1, 2017 and $200.0 million on September 1, 2017, in each instance so long as no cash flow sweep period (as defined in the Company’s existing mortgage loan facility on file with the Securities Exchange Commission) is then in effect and continuing as of such date. Amounts drawn under the Facility and repaid may not be redrawn. The Facility will mature the earlier of (i) December 31, 2017 and (ii) the date on which the outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s existing mortgage and mezzanine facilities are repaid in full. The Facility may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part, without any penalty or premium. The principal amount of loans outstanding under the Facility will bear a base annual interest rate of 6.50%. If a cash flow sweep period were to occur and be continuing under the Company’s existing mortgage loan indebtedness (i) the interest rate on any outstanding advances would increase from and after such date by 1.50% per annum above the base interest rate and (ii) the interest rate on any advances made after such date would increase by 3.50% per annum above the base interest rate, in each case, for so long as the cash flow sweep is continuing. Accrued and unpaid interest will be payable in cash, except that during the continuance of a cash flow sweep period under the Company’s existing mortgage loan facility, the Company may defer the payment of interest which deferred amount would be added to the outstanding principal balance of the loans and on which interest would be payable from and after the date of such deferral. Dividend On February 28, 2017, the Company’s Board of Trustees declared a first quarter common stock dividend of $0.25 per each Class A and Class C common share. The dividend will be paid on April 13, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 31, 2017. Holders of units in Seritage Growth Properties, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) are entitled to an equal distribution per each Operating Partnership unit held as of March 31, 2017. On November 1, 2016, the Company’s Board of Trustees declared a fourth quarter common stock dividend of $0.25 per each Class A and Class C common share. The dividend was paid on January 12, 2017 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2016. Holders of units in Seritage Growth Properties, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) were entitled to an equal distribution per each Operating Partnership unit held as of December 31, 2016. Supplemental Report A Supplemental Report will be available in the Investors section of the Company’s website, www.seritage.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company makes reference to NOI, Total NOI, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Company FFO which are financial measures that include adjustments to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). None of Total NOI, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO or Company FFO, are measures that (i) represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) are indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions; (iii) are alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity; or (iv) should be considered alternatives to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the respective GAAP measures we deem most comparable have been provided in the tables accompanying this press release. Net Operating Income (""NOI”), Total NOI and Annualized Total NOI NOI is defined as income from property operations less property operating expenses. The Company believes NOI provides useful information regarding Seritage, its financial condition, and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. The Company also uses Total NOI, which includes its proportional share of unconsolidated properties. This form of presentation offers insights into the financial performance and condition of the Company as a whole given the Company’s ownership of unconsolidated properties that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method. The Company also considers Total NOI to be a helpful supplemental measure of its operating performance because it excludes from NOI non-recurring items such as termination fee income, as well as non-cash items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles. Annualized Total NOI is an estimate, as of the end of the reporting period, of the annual Total NOI to be generated by the Company’s portfolio including all signed leases and modifications to the Company’s master lease with Sears Holdings with respect to recaptured space. We calculate Annualized Total NOI by adding or subtracting current period adjustments for leases that commenced or expired during the period to Total NOI (as defined) for the period and annualizing, and then adding estimated annual Total NOI attributable to SNO leases and subtracting estimated annual Total NOI attributable to Sears Holdings’ space to be recaptured. Annualized Total NOI is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure for which the Company does not believe it can provide reconciling information to a corresponding forward-looking GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization (""EBITDA"") and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is defined as net income less depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income and other taxes. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries, but may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding its results of operations because it removes the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between the Company and other equity REITs, retail property owners who are not REITs, and other capital-intensive companies. The Company makes certain adjustments to EBITDA, which it refers to as Adjusted EBITDA, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized gain or loss on interest rate cap, litigation charges, acquisition-related expenses, and certain up-front-hiring and personnel costs, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results. Funds From Operations (""FFO"") and Company FFO FFO is calculated in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT""), which defines FFO as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from property sales, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets. The Company considers FFO a helpful supplemental measure of the operating performance for equity REITs and a complement to GAAP measures because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry. The Company makes certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Company FFO, to account for certain non-cash and non-comparable items, such as termination fee income, unrealized gain or loss on interest rate cap, litigation charges, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of deferred financing costs and certain up-front-hiring and personnel costs, that it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results. The Company previously referred to this metric as Normalized FFO; the definition and calculation remain the same.

About Seritage Growth Properties Seritage Growth Properties is a publicly-traded, self-administered and self-managed retail REIT with 235 wholly-owned properties and 31 JV properties totaling over 42 million square feet of space across 49 states and Puerto Rico. Pursuant to a master lease, 203 of the Company’s wholly-owned properties are leased to Sears Holdings and are operated under either the Sears or Kmart brand. The master lease provides the Company with the right to recapture certain space from Sears Holdings at each property for retenanting or redevelopment purposes. At several properties, third-party tenants under direct leases occupy a portion of leasable space alongside Sears and Kmart, and 20 properties are leased only to third parties. The Company also owns 50% interests in 31 properties through JV investments with General Growth Properties, Inc., Simon Property Group, Inc., and The Macerich Company. A substantial majority of the space at the Company’s JV properties is also leased to Sears Holdings under master lease agreements that provide for similar recapture rights as the master lease governing the Company’s wholly-owned properties. &nbsp;

Deputy District Director Blake Hopper from the office of U.S. Representative Randy Weber (District 14) joined representatives from CommunityBank of Texas, Legacy CDC and FHLB Dallas to celebrate the award. $10K grant from @FHLBDallas and CommunityBank of Texas to provide easier access to affordable housing in BeaumontTweet this Legacy CDC provides housing opportunities, education and supportive services to help low- to moderate-income families achieve stability and self-sufficiency. The nonprofit organization will use the grant funds to offset the cost of an audit. “Audits are expensive for nonprofits, but they’re necessary for eligibility for other grant funding,” explained Vivian Ballou, executive director of Legacy CDC. “The partnership with CommunityBank and FHLB Dallas is a blessing for us to be able to get the audit done and put us in a position to receive other funding.” This is the organization’s first PGP award. Greater Beaumont Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Regina Lindsey said the grant funds will help Legacy CDC effect positive change in the community. “Beaumont is currently experiencing a strong housing market. It is important for a community to offer inventory at a variety of price points to allow for upward mobility of its residents,” said Ms. Lindsey. “We are excited about the opportunity this grant offers residents to begin the journey of home ownership,” she said. Ms. Ballou worked with CommunityBank of Texas Senior Vice President Kirk Smith during the grant application process. “We are committed to supporting the community and are proud to do so through programs like the PGP,” said Mr. Smith. “Our partnership with FHLB Dallas strengthens our bond with the community.” The structure of the PGP allows FHLB Dallas member institutions like CommunityBank of Texas to make a contribution of $500 to $4,000 to a community-based organization (CBO), which FHLB Dallas will match at a 3:1 ratio. In 2016, FHLB Dallas awarded $225,000 in PGP funds to assist 23 CBOs. Combined with the $96,200 from member institutions, a total of $321,200 was awarded last year. “The Partnership Grant Program helps our members to create positive change in their communities,” said Greg Hettrick, first vice president and director of Community Investment at FHLB Dallas. “We are proud to support CommunityBank of Texas through the PGP.” Ms. Ballou said without the grant, Legacy CDC would have missed other funding opportunities. “We would have had to postpone the audit about six months until we received another round of funding from the city,” she said. “But then we would have lost opportunities to apply for additional funding.” About CommunityBank of Texas CommunityBank of Texas, N.A. is an independent, Texas-owned bank with assets in excess of $2.8 billion. Established in 2007, the bank has 37 branches and is the largest independent community bank headquartered in and focused on the financial needs of Houston and Southeast Texas.

About the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas is one of 11 district banks in the FHLBank system created by Congress in 1932. FHLB Dallas, with total assets of $58.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, is a member-owned cooperative that supports housing and community development by providing competitively priced advances and other credit products to approximately 850 members and associated institutions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Texas.

Our tenant industries remain fundamentally strong, and our pipeline is robust as we expect to close the CNL transaction along with additional investment opportunities.” A reconciliation of FFO to FFO as adjusted follows (unaudited, dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): &nbsp; &nbsp; Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 Amount &nbsp; &nbsp; FFO/share Amount &nbsp; &nbsp; FFO/share FFO available to common shareholders (1) $ 80,424 $ 1.25 $ 71,341 $ 1.18 Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff — — 9 &nbsp; — Gain on insurance recovery (included in other income) (847 ) (0.01 ) — — Transaction costs 2,988 0.05 700 0.01 Gain on sale of land (1,430 ) (0.02 ) — — Deferred income tax benefit (401 ) (0.01 ) (1,366 ) (0.02 ) FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders (1) $ 80,734 &nbsp; $ 1.26 &nbsp; $ 70,684 &nbsp; $ 1.17 &nbsp; &nbsp; Dividends declared per common share $ 0.960 $ 0.908 FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders payout ratio 76 % 78 % View Full Table (1) &nbsp; Per share results for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include the effect of the conversion of the 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares as the conversion would be dilutive. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended December 31, 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 Amount &nbsp; &nbsp; FFO/share Amount &nbsp; &nbsp; FFO/share FFO available to common shareholders (2) $ 304,635 $ 4.77 $ 235,198 $ 4.03 Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff 905 0.01 270 — Gain on insurance recovery (included in other income) (4,684 ) (0.07 ) — — Termination fee included in gain on sale 2,819 0.04 — — Transaction costs 7,869 0.12 7,518 0.12 Retirement severance expense — — 18,578 0.31 Gain on sale of land (2,496 ) (0.04 ) (81 ) — Deferred income tax benefit (1,065 ) (0.01 ) (1,136 ) (0.02 ) FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders (2) $ 307,983 &nbsp; $ 4.82 &nbsp; $ 260,347 &nbsp; $ 4.44 &nbsp; &nbsp; Dividends declared per common share $ 3.840 $ 3.630 FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders payout ratio 80 % 82 % View Full Table (2) &nbsp; Per share results for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include the effect of the conversion of the 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares as the conversion would be dilutive. &nbsp; Portfolio Update The Company's investment portfolio (excluding property under development) consisted of the following at December 31, 2016: The Entertainment segment included investments in 141 megaplex theatres, eight entertainment retail centers (which include eight additional megaplex theatres) and eight family entertainment centers. The Company’s portfolio of owned entertainment properties consisted of 12.5 million square feet and was 99% leased, including megaplex theatres that were 100% leased. The Education segment included investments in 67 public charter schools, 41 early education centers and 12 private schools. The Company’s portfolio of owned education properties consisted of 4.3 million square feet and was 100% leased. The Recreation segment included investments in 11 ski areas, five waterparks and 25 golf entertainment complexes. The Company’s portfolio of owned recreation properties was 100% leased. The Other segment consisted primarily of the land under ground lease, property under development and land held for development related to the Adelaar casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York. The combined owned portfolio consisted of 19.2 million square feet and was 99.5% leased. As of December 31, 2016, the Company also had a total of $297.1 million invested in property under development. Investment Update The Company's investment spending during the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $278.1 million (bringing the full year 2016 total investment spending to $805.0 million), and included investments in each of its primary operating segments: Entertainment investment spending during the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $67.8 million, including spending on build-to-suit development and redevelopment of megaplex theatres, entertainment retail centers and family entertainment centers, as well as $18.1 million to acquire a megaplex theatre. Education investment spending during the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $151.4 million, including spending on an investment in mortgage notes totaling $100.0 million secured by 20 early education and private school properties. Additionally education investment spending included spending on build-to-suit development and redevelopment of public charter schools, early education centers and private schools, as well as $8.1 million in acquisitions of two early education centers. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company funded an additional $42.9 million in mortgage notes secured by eight early education and private school properties. Recreation investment spending during the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $58.3 million and was primarily related to spending on build-to-suit development of golf entertainment complexes and waterparks, as well as redevelopment of a ski area. Other investment spending during the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $0.6 million, and was related to the Adelaar casino and resort project in Sullivan County, New York. Capital Recycling The Company continues to make excellent progress on its asset disposition and capital recycling plan. During the fourth quarter, the Company sold ten properties for total proceeds of approximately $90.4 million and recognized a net gain on sale of real estate of $1.4 million. Eight of the properties sold were public charter schools previously leased to Imagine Schools under a master lease. Seven of these eight properties were sold to Imagine and the other one was sold to a third party. In conjunction with these sales the Company received proceeds totaling $87.2 million, consisting of $20.1 million in cash and a mortgage note receivable from Imagine. Imagine also added four additional public charter school properties as further collateral for the mortgage note. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of these schools. Accordingly, as of year-end, the Company's investments with Imagine consisted of 12 public charter school properties remaining under the master lease that had a carrying value of $102.7 million, and a five year $70.3 million mortgage note receivable with amortization bearing interest at 7% that was secured by 11 public charter school properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received asset disposition proceeds totaling $186.4 million, including the $91.3 million from sales of properties previously leased to Imagine discussed above. In 2017, the Company expects an additional $150.0 million to $300.0 million of asset disposition proceeds, including approximately $50.0 million from sales of additional public charter schools currently leased to Imagine. Balance Sheet Update The Company had a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) of 5.5x at December 31, 2016. The Company had $19.3 million of unrestricted cash on hand and nothing outstanding under its $650 million unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. On December 14, 2016, the Company issued $450.0 million in senior unsecured notes due on December 15, 2026. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.75% and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company used the net proceeds from the note offering to pay down its unsecured revolving credit facility, invest in mortgage notes secured by education properties and for general business purposes. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company prepaid in full two mortgage notes payable totaling $17.9 million with a weighted average annual interest rate of 6.07%, which were secured by two theatre properties. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company issued 548 thousand common shares under its Direct Share Purchase Plan (DSPP) for net proceeds of $40.8 million. These proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility. Dividend Information The Company declared regular monthly cash dividends during the fourth quarter of 2016 totaling $0.96 per common share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company declared dividends totaling $3.84 per common share, an increase of 5.8% over the prior year. The Company also declared fourth quarter cash dividends of $0.359375 per share on its 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares, $0.5625 per share on its 9.00% Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares and $0.4140625 per share on its 6.625% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred shares. As previously announced, the Company declared a regular monthly cash dividend to common shareholders of $0.34 per common share for the month of January 2017. This dividend level represents an annualized dividend of $4.08 per common share, an increase of 6.25% over 2016, and would be the Company’s seventh consecutive year with a significant annual dividend increase. CNL Transaction Update As previously announced, on November 2, 2016, the Company and Ski Resort Holdings LLC (""SRH""), an entity owned by funds affiliated with Och-Ziff Real Estate, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. (""CNL"") and certain of its affiliates. The agreement provides for the Company's acquisition of the Northstar California Ski Resort, 15 attraction properties (waterparks and amusement parks) and five small family entertainment centers for aggregate consideration valued at approximately $456.0 million. Additionally, the Company has agreed to provide approximately $244.0 million of five-year secured debt financing to SRH for the purchase of 14 CNL ski properties valued at approximately $374.0 million. This debt financing will be secured by mortgages on all of the assets being acquired by SRH. The CNL transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the transaction by stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of CNL and various third party consents and governmental permits. The special meeting of CNL stockholders has been scheduled for March 24, 2017. It is anticipated that this transaction will close in the second quarter of 2017; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing. 2017 Guidance The Company is confirming its 2017 guidance for FFO as adjusted per diluted share of a range of $5.05 to $5.20. In addition, the Company is confirming its 2017 investment spending guidance of a range of $1.30 billion to $1.35 billion. In addition to the on-going investments in each of our primary business segments, this guidance includes the estimated impact of the planned investments associated with the CNL transaction totaling approximately $700.0 million as well as the estimated impact of planned asset dispositions, both of which are discussed further above. There can be no assurances that these transactions will occur. FFO as adjusted guidance for 2017 is based on FFO per diluted share of $4.71 to $4.82 adjusted for estimated transaction costs, termination fees related to education properties and deferred income tax benefit. FFO per diluted share is based on a net income per diluted share range of $3.52 to $3.67 less estimated gain on sale of real estate of a range of $0.52 to $0.56 and the impact of Series C and Series E dilution of $0.05, plus estimated real estate depreciation of $1.76 per diluted share (in accordance with the NAREIT definition of FFO).

NAREIT developed FFO as a relative non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP and management provides FFO herein because it believes this information is useful to investors in this regard. FFO is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share. Pursuant to the definition of FFO by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, the Company calculates FFO as net income available to common shareholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales [or acquisitions] of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other affiliates. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other affiliates are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company has calculated FFO for all periods presented in accordance with this definition. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. FFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs and is not to be considered an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measure as a measurement of the results of our operations or our cash flows or liquidity as defined by GAAP. In addition to FFO, the Company presents FFO as adjusted. Management believes it is useful to provide it here as a supplemental measure to GAAP net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share. FFO as adjusted is FFO plus provision for loan losses, costs (gain) associated with loan refinancing or payoff, net, retirement severance expense, preferred share redemption costs, termination fees associated with tenants' exercises of education properties buy-out options and transaction costs (benefit), less gain on early extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on sale of land, gain on insurance recovery and deferred tax benefit (expense). FFO as adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure. FFO as adjusted does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and is not indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs and is not to be considered an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measure as a measurement of the results of the Company's operations, cash flows or liquidity as defined by GAAP. It should also be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO or FFO as adjusted the same way so comparisons of each of these non-GAAP measures with other REITs may not be meaningful. &nbsp; The conversion of the 5.75% Series C cumulative convertible preferred shares would be dilutive to FFO per share and FFOAA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Therefore, the additional 2.0 million common shares that would result from the conversion and the corresponding add-back of the preferred dividends declared on those shares are included in the calculation of diluted FFO and diluted FFOAA per share for these periods. The effect of the conversion of our 9.0% Series E cumulative convertible preferred shares and the additional 1.6&nbsp;million common shares that would result from the conversion do not result in more dilution to per share results and are therefore not included in the calculation of diluted per share data for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is a supplemental measure derived from non-GAAP financial measures the Company uses to evaluate its capital structure and the magnitude of its debt against its operating performance. The Company believes that investors commonly use versions of this ratio in a similar manner. In addition, financial institutions use versions of this ratio in connection with debt agreements to set pricing and covenant limitations. The Company's method of calculating Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Reconciliations of debt and net income available to common shareholders (both reported in accordance with GAAP) to Net Debt, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) are included in the following tables (unaudited, in thousands): &nbsp; &nbsp; December 31, 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 Net Debt: (B) Debt $ 2,485,625 $ 1,981,920 Deferred financing costs, net 29,320 18,289 Cash and cash equivalents (19,335 ) (4,283 ) Net Debt $ 2,495,610 &nbsp; $ 1,995,926 &nbsp; &nbsp; Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Adjusted EBITDA: (C) Net income available to common shareholders of EPR Properties $ 52,190 $ 46,799 Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff — 9 Interest expense, net 26,834 20,792 Transaction costs 2,988 700 Depreciation and amortization 28,351 24,915 Equity in income from joint ventures (118 ) (268 ) Gain on sale of real estate (1,430 ) — Income tax benefit (1) (84 ) (936 ) Preferred dividend requirements 5,951 5,951 Gain on insurance recovery (2) (847 ) — &nbsp; Adjusted EBITDA (for the quarter) $ 113,835 &nbsp; $ 97,962 &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 455,340 &nbsp; $ 391,848 &nbsp; &nbsp; Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 5.5 5.1 &nbsp; (1) Includes discontinued operations (2) Included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Other income includes the following: Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Income from settlement of foreign currency swap contracts $ 705 $ 705 Fee income 1,588 — Gain on insurance recovery 847 — Miscellaneous income 87 &nbsp; 508 &nbsp; Other income $ 3,227 &nbsp; $ 1,213 &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is multiplied by four to calculate an annual amount. &nbsp; (B) &nbsp; Net Debt represents debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) adjusted to exclude deferred financing costs, net and reduced for cash and cash equivalents. By excluding deferred financing costs, net and reducing debt for cash and cash equivalents on hand, the result provides an estimate of the contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, net of cash available to repay it. The Company believes this calculation constitutes a beneficial supplemental non-GAAP financial disclosure to investors in understanding our financial condition. The Company's method of calculating Net Debt may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. &nbsp; (C) Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in its analysis of the performance of the business and operations of the Company. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it excludes various items that management believes are not indicative of operating performance, and that it is an informative measure to use in computing various financial ratios to evaluate the Company. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income available to common shareholders excluding costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff, interest expense (net), depreciation and amortization, equity in (income) loss from joint ventures, gain (loss) on the sale of real estate, gain on insurance recovery, income tax expense (benefit), preferred dividend requirements, the effect of non-cash impairment charges, retirement severance expense, the provision for loan losses and transaction costs (benefit), and which is then multiplied by four to get an annual amount. &nbsp; The Company's method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance under GAAP, does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs, including distributions. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. &nbsp; About EPR Properties EPR Properties is a specialty real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in properties in select market segments which require unique industry knowledge, while offering the potential for stable and attractive returns.

Same-property NOI excluding redevelopments increased by 4.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, which was driven primarily by increased minimum rent throughout the portfolio from new rent commencements, lease renewals and contractual rent increases at properties including Westwood Complex, Buckhead Station and Willows Shopping Center. Same-property NOI for the broader same-property pool including redevelopments increased by 6.3% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 largely due to 17.1% NOI growth from redevelopment assets, especially at 101 7th Avenue. A reconciliation of net income attributable to Equity One, Inc. to same-property NOI is provided in the tables accompanying this press release. On a same-property basis, occupancy for the company’s retail portfolio was 95.7%, up 40 basis points as compared to September 30, 2016 and down 30 basis points as compared to December 31, 2015. One of the company’s anchor tenants, The Sports Authority, filed for bankruptcy in March 2016, which ultimately led to the rejection of all of the company’s four leases. The four leases comprised a total of 108,000 square feet of GLA and aggregate annualized base rent of approximately $3.8 million. The company executed leases totaling approximately 93,000 square feet of GLA at three of these locations (Broadway Plaza, The Gallery at Westbury Plaza and Westbury Plaza) at an aggregate annualized base rent of approximately $3.4 million, which exceeds the rent previously paid by The Sports Authority in those locations. Two of the new tenants commenced rent in October 2016 and the other new tenant is expected to commence paying rent in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company is actively marketing the one remaining location. Development and Redevelopment Activities As of December 31, 2016, the company had approximately $232.8 million of active development and redevelopment projects underway of which $89.8 million remained to be incurred. At Serramonte Center in Daly City, California, construction is underway on all significant components of the $109.1 million, 247,000 square foot multi-phased redevelopment. The entertainment portion of the project, anchored by Dave &amp; Buster’s, opened and commenced paying rent during the fourth quarter of 2016. Daiso also opened during the fourth quarter of 2016. The balance to complete this project is estimated at $53.8 million as of December 31, 2016. At Countryside Shops in Cooper City, Florida, the company continued site work during the fourth quarter of 2016 to build a new 45,600 square foot store for Publix that is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2017, reconfigure existing space to accommodate Ross Dress for Less, and make other enhancements to the center. The balance to complete this project is estimated at $15.7 million as of December 31, 2016. At Pablo Plaza, in Jacksonville, Florida, an $18.0 million project is underway which will add a Whole Foods specialty grocery anchor, add a PetSmart junior anchor, reconfigure shop space to accommodate another junior anchor, and add a Chipotle as an outparcel to the center. Both PetSmart and the Chipotle opened for business and commenced paying rent during the fourth quarter of 2016. The company closed on the purchase of a 4,000 square foot outparcel, adjacent to the property and occupied by Mattress Firm, for $2.6 million in November 2016. The balance to complete this project is estimated at $10.6 million as of December 31, 2016. At Point Royale in Miami, Florida, the approximately 50,500 square foot space built for Burlington substantially replaces the space previously leased to Best Buy. Burlington opened and commenced paying rent during the fourth quarter of 2016. The company is in discussions with national tenants to lease the center’s remaining 30,000 square feet of junior anchor space. The total budget for the redevelopment of Point Royale is estimated at $9.8 million with a balance to complete of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2016. Acquisition and Disposition Activity In October 2016, the company acquired San Carlos Marketplace, a 153,510 square foot shopping center located in San Carlos, California, for $97.0 million and paid $3.4 million for the prepayment penalty on the existing mortgage loan encumbering the property that was not assumed in the acquisition. The property is 100% leased and anchored by TJMaxx/HomeGoods, Best Buy, PetSmart and Bassett Furniture. In connection with this transaction, the company drew the remaining $75.0 million under its $300.0 million delayed draw term loan facility. In December 2016, the company closed on the sale of Thomasville Commons located in Thomasville, North Carolina, for a gross sales price of $2.7 million. Additionally, subsequent to year end, the company closed on the sale of Lantana Village located in Lantana, Florida, Riverview Shopping Center located in Durham, North Carolina, and Centre Pointe Plaza located in Smithfield, North Carolina for an aggregate gross sales price of $34.1 million. Balance Sheet Highlights At December 31, 2016, the company’s total market capitalization (including debt and equity) was $5.9 billion, comprising 145.3 million shares of common stock outstanding (on a fully diluted basis) valued at approximately $4.5 billion and approximately $1.4 billion of debt (excluding any debt premium/discount). The company’s ratio of net debt (net of cash) to total market capitalization was 23.9%. At December 31, 2016, the company had approximately $16.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $118.0 million outstanding under its $850.0 million revolving credit facility. During the quarter, the company did not sell any shares of its common stock under its “at-the-market” equity offering program. ACCOUNTING AND OTHER DISCLOSURES The company believes FFO (combined with the primary presentations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)) is a useful, supplemental measure of its operating performance that is a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry and, in particular, REITs. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) stated in its April 2002 White Paper on Funds from Operations, “Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.” FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is “net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of, or impairment charges related to, depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.” NAREIT further states that “adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.” The company makes certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Core FFO, to account for items it does not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, including transaction costs associated with acquisition and disposition activity and other financing and investing activities, merger expenses, impairment of goodwill, land and joint venture investments, severance and reorganization costs, gains (or losses) on the extinguishment of debt, and gains (or losses) on the disposal of non-depreciable assets. The company also believes that Core FFO is a useful, supplemental measure of its core operating performance that facilitates comparability of historical financial periods. The company believes that the presentation of comparable period operating results generated from its FFO and Core FFO measures provides financial analysts, investors and stockholders with more complete information regarding the company's performance than they would have without the presentation of this information. The company uses NOI and cash NOI, which are non-GAAP financial measures, internally as performance measures and believes NOI and cash NOI provide useful information to investors regarding the company’s financial condition and results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and when compared across periods, reflect the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and disposition activity on an unleveraged basis. In this release, the company has provided NOI information on a same-property basis. Information provided on a same-property basis, unless otherwise noted, includes the results of properties that the company consolidated, owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and excludes non-retail properties and properties for which significant development or redevelopment occurred during either of the periods being compared. The same-property pool including redevelopments includes those properties that the company consolidated, owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, including properties for which significant redevelopment occurred during either of the periods being compared, but excluding non-retail properties and development properties. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the company moved three properties that had been under redevelopment (Boynton Plaza, Kirkman Shoppes and Willows Shopping Center) with 473,210 square feet into the same-property pool. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the company moved one property that had been under redevelopment (Alafaya Commons) with 130,811 square feet into the same-property pool and moved one property (Point Royale), with 182,339 square feet out of the same-property pool as it is undergoing redevelopment. The company’s method of calculating FFO, Core FFO, NOI, cash NOI and same-property NOI may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO, Core FFO, NOI, cash NOI and same-property NOI are presented to assist investors in analyzing the company’s operating performance. Neither FFO, Core FFO, NOI, cash NOI nor same-property NOI (i) represents cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, (ii) is indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions, (iii) is an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, or (iv) should be considered as an alternative to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating the company’s operating performance. The company believes net income attributable to Equity One, Inc. is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO, Core FFO, NOI, cash NOI and same-property NOI. Reconciliations of these measures to their respective comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the tables accompanying this press release. Retail occupancy as used herein refers to the company’s consolidated portfolio and excludes developments and redevelopments and non-retail and unconsolidated joint venture properties.

(2) Includes the remeasurement of the fair value of the company's equity interest in the GRI JV of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. (3) Represents earnings attributed to convertible units held by Liberty International Holdings Limited (“LIH”) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015. Although these convertible units are excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, FFO available to diluted common stockholders includes earnings allocated to LIH, as the inclusion of these units is dilutive to FFO per diluted share. In January 2016, LIH exercised its redemption right with respect to all of its outstanding convertible units in the CapCo joint venture, and the company elected to satisfy the redemption through the issuance of approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock to LIH. LIH subsequently sold the shares of common stock in a public offering that closed on January 19, 2016. (4) Represents costs primarily associated with acquisition and disposition activity of $3.5 million and $4.4 million, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, as well as costs of $348,000 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the company’s issuance of shares of common stock to satisfy the exercise of LIH’s redemption right and the subsequent sale of these shares by LIH in a public offering. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, includes $300,000 and $1.8 million, respectively, of acquisition and disposition costs, and $773,000 and $908,000, respectively, of costs associated with a financing transaction that was not consummated, the initiation of the company's “at-the-market” equity offering program, and affiliate public offerings. (5) Represents expenses associated with the company's pending merger with Regency. (6) For the year ended December 31, 2016, represents severance expenses. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, primarily includes costs associated with the company's executive transition and severance expenses. (7) Weighted average diluted shares used to calculate FFO per share and Core FFO per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 is higher than the GAAP diluted weighted average shares as a result of the dilutive impact of the 11.4 million joint venture units that were held by LIH which were convertible into the company's common stock. These convertible units were not included in the diluted weighted average share count for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 for GAAP purposes because their inclusion was anti-dilutive. &nbsp; EQUITY ONE, INC.

Indian LED Lighting Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2017-2022 provides a techno-commercial roadmap for setting up an LED manufacturing plant. LED lights have emerged as a powerful source for lighting over the past several years. Due to their numerous advantages over conventional lighting technology, they have swiftly gained prominence in the Indian lighting market. Although Indian LED lighting market is at a nascent stage, it offers innumerable opportunities for growth over the next few decades. As India represents one of the biggest lighting markets, it offers a lucrative option for LED manufacturers to set up their facilities in the region. Skilled labor, ease of doing business and demographic advantages provides a sustainable environment for the LED industry. Currently, the demand for LED lighting systems is primarily concentrated in the North and South regions due to growing urbanization rates and increasing number of government initiatives that encourage the use of LED lights. The government's support through various regulations that promote the investments in energy efficient lighting technologies have expanded the applications of LED lights across various industrial, commercial and residential sectors. A rapidly growing automotive industry also provides productive opportunities for the use of LEDs in head lamps, rear lamps, turn signal and brake lights. Other important factors such as increasing infrastructural investments, rapid growth of street lighting systems, decline in average prices of LEDs and various government and upcoming smart building projects are expected to drive the demand of LED lights in India.

This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. An HVAC control system is used for regulating the temperature, humidity, and airflow within a closed environment to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. The global rise in construction activities is creating a large demand for new HVAC systems, which is acting as a key driving factor for the market.

Based on the component, the report categorizes the global HVAC control systems market into the following segments: Sensors Controlled devices Controllers Sensors “The HVAC control systems market by sensors is responsible for generating over 40% of the overall revenue and is expected to retain its lead over the forecast period. Sensors are used to measure and detect changes in temperature, humidity, occupancy or airflow, and pressure,” says Bharath Kanniappan, one of the lead analysts at Technavio for automation research. Sensors act as a link between the HVAC systems and end-users, with advanced sensors capable of communicating with thermostats, mobile applications, and the Internet. These sensors can also assist building owners in optimizing their energy use and minimize the cost incurred due to HVAC systems. Additionally, many vendors are heavily investing into enhancing the sensors, which adds a significant amount of revenue to the market. Controlled devices The rise in the number of buildings requiring various floor level and controlled devices for monitoring the performance of HVAC systems will drive the demand for the market. Smart home automation is another key factor driving the market for advanced controlled devices. Smart thermostats that can integrate residential HVAC units with home automation systems will witness a rise over the forecast period. Vendors are currently focusing on introducing advanced and innovative controlled devices capable of streamlining the operations of HVAC units. Controllers “Standalone or networked controllers are installed in buildings to manage the HVAC controls and act as the central processing unit of the entire HVAC system. HVAC controllers analyze the change detected by sensors, compares it against set parameters, and finally provides the output through the controlled devices,” says Bharath. Standalone controllers constitute more than 75% of the market segment, and are traditionally deployed to monitor, control and regulate various paraments such as temperature, pressure, air flow, and relative humidity of an HVAC system. Smart controllers will gain increasing prominence over the forecast period, but standalone controllers will remain the more popular segment. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio’s research analysts in this report are: Honeywell International Johnson Controls Schneider Electric ABB Cylon Trane Browse Related Reports: Global HVAC Air Ducts Market 2017-2021 Global Automotive HVAC Market 2016-2020 Global HVAC Insulation Market 2016-2020 Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.

In addition, PMI CEO/Executive Director Barbara C. Higgens is available for background or comment on any of the following issues: Untapped water-saving potential of water-efficient plumbing products PMI and the Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE) have a study in progress to determine potential water savings that could be achieved by replacing older, inefficient toilets with water-efficient models. With results due in spring 2017, the “Saturation Study of Non-Efficient Water Closets in Key States” is focused on Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia and Texas – all states that have experienced serious water shortages. This research follows up a 2015 PMI/GMP Research, Inc., study of water-efficient toilets, showerheads and faucets installed nationwide. Potential threats to safe drinking water Another PMI study, now in progress under the direction of Dr. Paul Sturman of Montana State University, will test the hypothesis that low flow rates yield a greater proliferation of opportunistic waterborne pathogens, such as legionella, in potable water and create unsafe conditions. The results of this study also are expected this spring. PMI is also awaiting with interest the results of a Virginia Tech study under the direction of Drs. Amy Pruden and Marc Edwards that is exploring the relative abundance and diversity of antibiotic-resistant genes and pathogens in reclaimed (recycled) versus potable water distribution systems. With results due in spring 2017, this study is particularly relevant given plans in California to expand the installation of recycled water systems that use non-potable water in toilets and urinals and with personal hygiene devices (bidet seats) installed by consumers after construction. Virginia Tech researchers also recently released the results of a study concluding that interrupted corrosion control caused the Flint water crisis. Need for a restored national water infrastructure With an aging underground water infrastructure having been identified as a contributor to lead-in-water crises in Flint and other locations, Congressional leaders from both parties have expressed interest in developing job-creating legislation that would restore American infrastructure. PMI will be urging Congress to address water infrastructural concerns through this legislation. Last summer, PMI introduced its water infrastructure advocacy through a position paper and infographic. About PMI Plumbing Manufacturers International is the voluntary, not-for-profit international industry association of manufacturers of plumbing products, serving as the Voice of the Plumbing Industry. Member companies produce 90 percent of the nation’s plumbing products. As part of its mission, PMI advocates for plumbing product performance and innovation contributing to water savings, sustainability, public health and safety, and consumer satisfaction.

Net Asset Value (NAV) estimates should be higher, towards $31 per share, based on new Company disclosures, versus current estimates around $28 and yesterday’s closing price of $22.88; and | 2. Nothing has changed at Forest City since shareholders agreed to pay off the Ratner family with ~$120 million, or a 31% premium, to give up their super voting B shares and there is no meaningful change in sight under the current leadership. When asked by an analyst on the Company’s earnings call yesterday what has changed since the December 6th, 2016 announcement that the dual-share class structure would be collapsed, CEO David LaRue offered investors little hope of real change: “Well, the sun still comes up every day and still sets every day.” Then Mr. LaRue went on to articulate the same board-approved approach and strategy that has existed for the past several years. It is clearly business as usual at Forest City. What Forest City's Board apparently fails to realize is that the dual-class share structure was not itself an impediment to NAV realization, but an impediment to the changes necessary to realize NAV. Getting rid of the B shares is a means to an end, not the end. Substantial changes remain necessary at the Company: First and foremost, the Ratners should get their hands out of the cookie jar. By our last count at least ten Ratners remain on the payroll and continue to feed at the Company trough in addition to the Company providing tax protections for Bruce Ratner. Second, the Board continues to lack independence. The two new independent directors, who have not been identified and may not be directors shareholders would choose, are outgunned by the eleven Ratner legacy directors. A substantial number of new independent directors should be added to the Board with input from shareholders, including Land and Buildings. Additional oversight is desperately needed by a new invigorated Board as the Company redeploys $2.2 billion of shareholder capital from the pending retail portfolio sales given that under the current Board the Company recognized a similar amount of write downs in the past decade. The Board should fully explore distributing proceeds from the $2.2 billion retail assets sales to shareholders utilizing tax efficient strategies we have communicated to the Board. Forest City has suffered for decades from poor operating margins and bloated general and administrative expenses. To date, management appears to be conflating true margin improvements with asset sales and mix shift. How can the bloated costs be truly improved when the Ratners continue to feed at the trough? We reiterate our strong belief that significant corporate governance enhancements are necessary at Forest City.

Private Equity’s Irish Adventure: Has Tax Avoidance Put Limited Partners Outside Their Comfort Zone?Tweet this The full report is&nbsp;available here. Key Points: In the wake of the financial crisis, the Irish government took steps to rescue its largest banks, including the creation of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), which was tasked with acquiring property-related loans from distressed banks. The government’s rescue measures – and subsequent mortgage portfolio sales to private investors – have received considerable criticism within the Irish media and political arena. Funds managed by Oaktree provided debt capital to Mars Capital Ireland, a special purpose vehicle that benefited from Section 110 tax provisions, to fund the acquisition of residential mortgage loans from NAMA through the IBRC liquidation. Mars Capital Ireland is a bankruptcy remote vehicle owned by three charitable trusts that are linked to the Matheson Foundation, the corporate philanthropy initiative of Matheson, a global corporate law firm with headquarters in Dublin. After deducting all interest expenses, Mars Capital Ireland reported a profit before tax margin of approximately 0.007% in 2015; the company reported taxes of €250. Questions for limited partners: Were limited partners informed of the potential use of section 110 SPVs to gain exposure to residential mortgages in Ireland? Does Oaktree have formal policies for the assessment of risks related to tax avoidance measures? If so, how are the risks reported to limited partners?

We’re also seeing buyers who expect that because it’s still the winter, prices are lower and there’s less competition if they can just find a home soon. ”Tweet this This marks the highest level recorded since January 2013, the first month measured by the index. The Redfin Housing Demand Index is based on thousands of Redfin customers requesting home tours and writing offers. A level of 100 represents the historical average for the three-year period from January 2013 to December 2015. “Soaring stock markets, still low mortgage rates and a steady economy bolstered homebuyers at the start of 2017,” said Redfin chief economist Nela Richardson. “Homebuyers were not just window shopping, they were serious about making offers and getting to the closing table. However, this uptick in homebuyer enthusiasm won’t guarantee strong sales in the coming months. With pending home sales down across the country in January despite strong demand, the lack of supply is a formidable foe for buyers this year.” Compared to December, the seasonally adjusted increase in buyers requesting tours was up 3.2 percent in January, while the seasonally adjusted change in buyers writing offers was up 13.0 percent. Homebuyer demand in January was far above the recent historical average. Compared to January 2016, homebuyer demand was up 22.9 percent, led by a 25.9 percent year-over-year increase in homebuyers requesting tours and an 18.0 percent increase in buyers making offers. The start of 2017 has had a notably limited selection for homebuyers, who saw 13.4 percent fewer homes on the market in January than the previous year, with 4.0 percent fewer new listings. Baltimore Buyers See Tax Breaks The Baltimore-area Demand Index level was at 157 in January, up 63.8 percent compared to this time last year. “Most of the offers my homebuying customers have made of late have been part of a multiple offer situation, and the homes I’ve listed have found buyers as quickly as two days, and most within two weeks,” said Redfin real estate agent Chris Calabretta. “Many builders are taking properties that need updating and renovating them to a high-end level while keeping the original charm, and then selling them for between $250,000 and $500,000, depending on which neighborhood. Developers are renovating to a historical standard required to get what is known as a CHAP credit, which gives buyers a 10 year discounted tax incentive. And depending on the level of renovation, some properties are instead coming with a five-year new construction tax credit. These types of properties are the most popular when they hit the market,” said Calabretta. And high prices in nearby Washington, D.C. are having an effect on the Baltimore housing market. “A lot of buyers realize that they can take the MARC commuter train from Baltimore and be in D.C. in an hour. More people are now acting on it. Since buying a house here is half the cost, Baltimore is where they’re looking,” said Redfin real estate agent Lynn Ikle. Boston Market Already Red-Hot The Boston-area Demand Index was at 174 in January, up 34.7 percent compared to this time last year. “The market has been unusually busy,” said Redfin real estate agent Sandy Rosen. “The weather has been mild and some buyers are worried about rates going up, so they’d prefer to buy now rather than later. We’re also seeing buyers who expect that because it’s still the winter, prices are lower and there’s less competition if they can just find a home soon. “Unfortunately, that’s not actually the case,” said Rosen. “It’s busy enough that prices aren’t especially lower. Instead, sellers are putting their homes on the market at intentionally low prices, drawing 10 or 15 offers, and then choosing from among the highest bidders. A home that looks like an incredible deal when it first lists almost always sells for far above the list price.” For additional national and local data and analysis, including metro-level charts and insights from real estate agents, please visit: https://www.redfin.com/blog/2017/02/the-redfin-housing-demand-index-continued-record-climb-in-january.html.

(NYSE: CCP) (“CCP” or the “Company”), a company with a diversified portfolio of triple-net leased healthcare properties focused on the post-acute sector, today announced operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. CCP began operating as an independent, publicly traded company in August 2015, following completion of its spin-off from Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas”). As previously explained, financial results reported for 2015 represent a combination of operating results that have been “carved-out” of Ventas’s consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the spin-off and standalone operating results for the period subsequent to the spin-off. “In addition, we paid an attractive dividend and enhanced our investment grade balance sheet. As we look ahead to 2017, we are focused on completing value-enhancing investments and managing our portfolio to invest and grow with quality operators.”Tweet this “We are pleased to have delivered strong results in 2016, while generating robust cash flow to reinvest in growing our business. Our many accomplishments included putting our permanent capital structure in place, improving our portfolio through acquisitions, portfolio redevelopment, dispositions and asset transitions and building out our standalone infrastructure,” CCP Chief Executive Officer Raymond J. Lewis said. “In addition, we paid an attractive dividend and enhanced our investment grade balance sheet. As we look ahead to 2017, we are focused on completing value-enhancing investments and managing our portfolio to invest and grow with quality operators.” Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results Net income attributable to CCP for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $37 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share. Normalized Funds from Operations (“FFO”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $59 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), for the same time period was $62 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share. Normalized FFO and NAREIT FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 were $71 million, or $0.85 per diluted common share, and $69 million, or $0.83 per diluted common share, respectively. The decreases in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the prior-year period are attributable primarily to an increase in interest expense resulting from the refinancing of short-term floating rate debt with longer term fixed rate debt during 2016 and the impact of dispositions completed in the year, partially offset by acquisitions and contractual rent increases. Full Year 2016 Financial Results For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income attributable to CCP was $123 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $255 million, or $3.05 per diluted common share. NAREIT FFO for the same period was $245 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share. Normalized FFO and NAREIT FFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $286 million, or $3.42 per diluted common share, and $277 million, or $3.31 per diluted common share, respectively. The decreases in 2016 over the prior year are due primarily to an increase in interest expense, as CCP had no debt outstanding prior to August 17, 2015 and the debt incurred in connection with the spin-off consisted entirely of floating rate bank debt. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $312 million in 2016 due primarily to investments completed in 2015 and 2016 and contractual rent escalations in 2016, partially offset by dispositions, asset transitions and lease restructurings. Cash flow from operations after routine capital expenditures and dividends (including the dividend declared in December 2016, but paid in January 2017) was $53 million. Operating Results During 2016, CCP made investments totaling approximately $77 million, including new asset purchases and loans receivable (but excluding any seller financing), at an average yield of 8.1%. In addition, the Company invested $38 million in development and redevelopment projects in 2016 at an approximate yield of 8.5%. During 2016, the Company disposed of 18 properties for gross proceeds of $124 million and entered into definitive agreements to sell another 23 properties for approximately $175 million, which sales are expected to close in the first half of 2017. The weighted average cap rate on dispositions completed in 2016 was approximately 8.1%. In 2016, the Company paid $1.6 million to Ventas under a transition services agreement for certain financial, tax and administrative support services. This agreement expired at the end of August 2016. Balance Sheet and Capital Markets Activities As previously announced, CCP refinanced $935 million of debt in 2016 and entered into interest rate swaps to fix the rate on $600 million of floating rate debt. The Company repaid all $600 million principal amount of its previous term loan due 2017 and $326 million principal amount of its term loan due 2020. At year end, CCP had floating rate debt of $233 million, or approximately 16% of total debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 3.8%. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $576 million of available borrowing capacity under its revolver, and its net debt to full-year Adjusted EBITDA was 4.7x, after giving effect to the fourth quarter dividend. Dividends For 2016, CCP paid dividends totaling $2.28 per share (inclusive of the fourth quarter dividend declared in December 2016 and paid in January 2017), reflecting a payout ratio of 75% based on normalized FFO. The Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2017 in the amount of $0.57 per share. The dividend is payable on March 31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March 10, 2017. 2017 Normalized FFO Guidance CCP currently expects its 2017 normalized FFO to range between $2.80 and $2.90 per diluted common share. NAREIT FFO is expected to range from $2.73 to $2.83 per diluted common share for the year. This 2017 guidance assumes: Dispositions totaling approximately $175 million at an average cap rate of approximately 9.5% and reinvestment of those proceeds at an average yield of approximately 9%. Redevelopment investments totaling approximately $20 million at an average yield of just over 8%. No additional acquisitions (beyond the reinvestment of $175 million of disposition proceeds) or debt or equity raises. CCP’s guidance is predicated on a number of other assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside of CCP’s control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that CCP will achieve these results. Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference Call CCP will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2016 results and 2017 guidance in more detail today at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time (9:00 A.M. Central Time). The dial-in number for the conference call is (888) 349-0115 or (412) 317-5143 for international callers and (855) 669-9657 for Canadian callers.

Factors that could cause CCP’s actual future results and trends to differ materially from those anticipated are discussed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and include, without limitation: (a) the ability and willingness of CCP’s tenants, borrowers and other counterparties to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with CCP, including, in some cases, their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold harmless CCP from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities; (b) the ability of CCP’s tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and liabilities to third parties, including without limitation obligations under their existing credit facilities and other indebtedness, and the impact of CCP’s tenants or borrowers declaring bankruptcy or becoming insolvent; (c) CCP’s ability to successfully execute its business strategy, including identifying, underwriting, financing, consummating and integrating suitable acquisitions and investments; (d) macroeconomic conditions such as a disruption in or lack of access to the capital markets, changes in the debt rating on U.S. government securities, default or delay in payment by the United States of its obligations, and changes in federal or state budgets resulting in the reduction or nonpayment of Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates; (e) the nature and extent of competition in the markets in which CCP’s properties are located; (f) the impact of pending and future healthcare reform and regulations, including cost containment measures, quality initiatives and changes in reimbursement methodologies, policies, procedures and rates; (g) increases in CCP’s borrowing costs as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors; (h) the ability of CCP’s tenants to successfully operate CCP’s properties in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, to deliver high-quality services, to hire and retain qualified personnel, to attract residents and patients, and to participate in government or managed care reimbursement programs; (i) changes in general economic conditions or economic conditions in the markets in which CCP may, from time to time, compete for investments, capital and talent, and the effect of those changes on CCP’s earnings and financing sources; (j) CCP’s ability to repay, refinance, restructure or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due; (k) CCP’s ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a REIT in light of economic, market, legal, tax and other considerations; (l) final determination of CCP’s taxable net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for current and future years; (m) the ability and willingness of CCP’s tenants to renew their leases with CCP upon expiration of the leases, CCP’s ability to reposition its properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or in the event CCP exercises its right to replace an existing tenant, and obligations, including indemnification obligations, CCP may incur in connection with the replacement of an existing tenant; (n) year-over-year changes in the Consumer Price Index and the effect of those changes on the rent escalators contained in CCP’s leases and on CCP’s earnings; (o) CCP’s ability and the ability of its tenants and borrowers to obtain and maintain adequate property, liability and other insurance from reputable, financially stable providers; (p) the impact of increased operating costs and uninsured professional liability claims on CCP’s or its tenants’ or borrowers’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and the ability of CCP and its tenants and borrowers to accurately estimate the magnitude of those costs and claims; (q) consolidation in the healthcare industry resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor’s investment in, one or more of CCP’s tenants or borrowers or significant changes in the senior management of CCP’s tenants or borrowers; (r) the impact of litigation or any financial, accounting, legal or regulatory issues, including government investigations, enforcement proceedings and punitive settlements, that may affect CCP or its tenants or borrowers; and (s) changes in accounting principles, or their application or interpretation, and CCP’s ability to make estimates and the assumptions underlying the estimates, which could have an effect on CCP’s earnings. Many of these factors are beyond the control of CCP and its management. &nbsp; &nbsp; CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands, except per share amounts) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 &nbsp;

However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, CCP considers FFO and normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. In particular, CCP believes that normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and CCP management to compare CCP’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events such as transactions. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. CCP defines normalized FFO as FFO excluding items which may be nonrecurring or recurring in nature but not consistent in amounts. FFO and normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of CCP’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of CCP’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of CCP’s needs. CCP believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of CCP, FFO and normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to CCP as presented elsewhere herein.

Our RevPAR growth rates exceeded the lodging industry which, when added to solid expense controls and great work by our field based teams of operators, resulted in outstanding performance over the quarter and year. The strong numbers allowed us to invest in our assets and future growth plans, to the tune of $225 million in capital expenditures, reduce our debt by $171 million and return $340 million to paired shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Investments in the estate, debt reduction and capital returned to shareholders are exactly the priorities we set forth in our Investor Day last June.” Mr. Lopez continued, “Looking to 2017, we are encouraged by the improved sense of consumer and business optimism we have seen across the country. These positive views, the completion of our last set of hotel renovations, as well as limited new supply in our chain-scale will allow us to stretch the current phase of the cycle.

Terms of the transactions were not disclosed. “We are excited to be moving forward on this project, which once again demonstrates how private sector infrastructure investors can create jobs, clean up an old dirty site, and reinvigorate the economy”Tweet this The project will feature the GE 7HA.02 gas turbine and a GE steam turbine, and will remediate and redevelop a site that was once home to a manufacturing facility. Birdsboro has retained Kiewit as the engineering, procurement and construction contractor, and it is expected that the project will create hundreds of jobs during construction and approximately 20 jobs on-site after completion. The plant is expected to begin commercial operations in the second quarter of 2019. “We are excited to be moving forward on this project, which once again demonstrates how private sector infrastructure investors can create jobs, clean up an old dirty site, and reinvigorate the economy,” said Ben Pike, a Vice President in the Ares EIF Group. “Birdsboro is another example of Ares EIF partnering with an independent developer successfully to complete a state-of-the-art combined-cycle power project,” said Mark Voccola, a Partner in the Ares EIF Group. “This strategic investment will benefit from efficient new turbine technology, a differentiated location with tremendous local support, and a once-in-a-generation transformation of the nation’s energy sector. Natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica are driving the power market towards a cleaner resource mix and lower cost for end consumers.” The Ares EIF Group, formerly known as Energy Investors Funds (EIF), was acquired by Ares in January 2015. Founded in 1987, Ares EIF has a 30-year track record and is one of the first managers focused on the independent power and electric utility industry. Ares EIF’s investment strategy is to create geographically and technologically diversified portfolios of energy infrastructure investments via acquisitions as well as development and construction across the power generation, transmission and midstream sectors.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not excluded from or included in the most comparable GAAP measure. We consider certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. GAAP accounting for real estate assets assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, even though real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions. As a result, many industry investors look to non-GAAP financial measures for supplemental information about real estate companies. You should not consider non-GAAP measures as alternatives to GAAP net income, which is an indicator of our financial performance, or as alternatives to GAAP cash flow from operating activities, which is a liquidity measure, nor are non-GAAP measures necessarily indicative of our ability to satisfy our funding requirements. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine our non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this report. Moreover, the comparability of non-GAAP financial measures across companies may be limited as a result of differences in the manner in which real estate companies calculate such measures, the capital structure of such companies or other factors. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein. NOI AND CASH NOI The Company evaluates the performance of each of its two business segments based on NOI. The Company defines NOI as total revenues less property-level operating expenses, which include property management fees, payroll expense and travel cost reimbursements to affiliates. The sum of the NOI for each segment is total NOI, which the Company uses to evaluate the aggregate performance of its segments. Management believes that NOI serves as a useful supplement to net income because it allows investors, analysts and management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare the Company’s operating results between periods and to the operating results of other real estate companies on a consistent basis. The Company defines cash NOI as NOI excluding the effects of straight-line rent, amortization of above / below market lease intangibles and amortization of deferred community fees and other, which includes the net change in deferred community fees and other rent discounts or incentives. Management believes that cash NOI serves as a useful supplement to NOI and net income because it represents actual cash received during the relevant reporting period. Same store NOI and cash NOI include only properties owned for the entirety of comparable periods and exclude assets classified as held for sale. FFO and Other Non-GAAP Measures We use Funds From Operations (""FFO"") and Normalized FFO as supplemental measures of our operating performance. We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate assets and impairment charges of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not account for debt principal payments and is not intended as a measure of a REIT’s ability to satisfy such payments or any other cash requirements. Normalized FFO, as defined below, measures the financial performance of our portfolio of assets excluding items that, although incidental to, are not reflective of the day-to-day operating performance of our portfolio of assets. We believe that Normalized FFO is useful because it facilitates the evaluation of our portfolio’s operating performance (i) between periods on a consistent basis and (ii) to the operating performance of other real estate companies. However, comparability may be limited because our calculation of Normalized FFO may differ significantly from that of other companies, or because of features of our business that are not present in other companies. We define Normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items, as applicable: (a) acquisition, transaction and integration related costs and expenses; (b) the write off of unamortized discounts, premiums, deferred financing costs, or additional costs, make whole payments and penalties or premiums incurred as the result of early repayment of debt (collectively “Gain (Loss) on extinguishment of debt”); (c) incentive compensation recognized as a result of sales of property and (d) other items that we believe are not indicative of operating performance, generally reported as “Other (income) expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management also uses AFFO and Normalized FAD as supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance. We define AFFO as Normalized FFO excluding the impact of the following: (a) straight-line rents; (b) amortization of above / below market lease intangibles; (c) amortization of deferred financing costs; (d) amortization of premium on mortgage notes payable and (e) amortization of deferred community fees and other, which includes the net change in deferred community fees and other rent discounts or incentives. We believe AFFO is useful because it facilitates the evaluation of (i) the current economic return on our portfolio of assets between periods on a consistent basis and (ii) our portfolio versus those of other real estate companies that report AFFO. However, comparability may be limited because our calculation of AFFO may differ significantly from that of other companies, or because of features of our business that are not present in other companies. We define Normalized FAD as AFFO less routine capital expenditures, which we view as a cost associated with the current economic return.

The award recognizes the project’s contributions to Cambodia in terms of environmental protection by reduced energy consumption. MinebeaMitsumi’s LED streetlight system is wirelessly connected for smart functions, such as parking sensors and electricity meters, which are supported by NTT Com’s global network and cloud services. The extra-efficient system cuts greenhouse gas emissions by 70% compared with conventional High Intensity Discharge (HID) lighting thanks to the reduced power consumption of LEDs and smart functions such as the wirelessly controlled shut-off and dimming of streetlights. The project was selected in June 2015 as the first of its kind to be supported under Japan’s Financing Program for Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) Model Projects. The program provides financial support to projects that help to reduce CO2 emissions in developing countries by introducing low-carbon technologies from Japan for energy savings or renewable energy use.

Keating, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “In the fourth quarter of 2016, we continued to execute on our key strategic initiatives to position Kaman for profitable growth. Against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop in certain of our end markets, we are successfully executing on our productivity and realignment programs to enhance margins and consistently deliver improved financial performance. As a key highlight, we are pleased to report gross margin of 31.3% for the quarter, a 310 bps increase over the fourth quarter of 2015 and a 140 bps increase over the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by improvements at Distribution. Demonstrating our focus on driving meaningful cash flow generation, 2016 was the third consecutive year in which Free Cash Flows* were greater than 130% of our Net Earnings. Sales in our Distribution segment continued to be impacted by ongoing weakness in our end markets resulting in a 3.2% decrease as compared to the same period last year. Organic Sales per Sales Day* decreased 4.9% for the fourth quarter when compared to the same period last year and declined 3.0% sequentially. Distribution operating margins in the quarter were 2.2%, a decrease of 30 bps compared to the same period last year. Importantly, this decrease includes the costs associated with the deployment of productivity initiatives designed to expand operating margins, which totaled $4.6 million for the fourth quarter and $12.6 million for the full year 2016. Excluding these costs, Distribution operating margins increased despite lower daily sales levels, which we believe underscores the merits of the actions we are taking. We expect to fully realize the benefits of our productivity initiatives, with significantly lower deployment costs, beginning in 2017. Our Aerospace segment performed largely in line with our expectations. Sales declined modestly in the fourth quarter; however, sales for the full year increased 17.5%, or 6.9% organically, when compared to the prior year. Strong demand for our missile and bomb fuze products drove organic growth while our bearings products delivered another solid performance throughout 2016. Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue new business opportunities for our fuze products in international markets, where demand remains robust. Aerospace operating margins increased 220 bps when compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year due to improved performance on our structures programs and the contribution from our bearings products. Prudent, value enhancing acquisitions that strengthen our technology leadership and expand the scope of our product offerings remain a core element of our growth strategy, and we are pleased to report positive performance for our most recent additions. Our acquisitions of EXTEX and GRW continue to perform above expectations and made significant top line contributions while being accretive to earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the full year."" Chief Financial Officer, Robert D. Starr, commented, ""In 2016 we delivered strong operating performance and continue to position Kaman for future growth. During the year, we invested $30 million in our operations through the purchase of property plant and equipment, repaid over $20 million in debt, reducing our Debt to Capitalization* ratio by 240 bps to 42.3%, and increased our cash on hand by $25 million. Our robust financial position continues to provide us flexibility to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders, and in 2016, we returned approximately $33 million of cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase program and dividend payments. Turning to our 2017 outlook, we expect Aerospace to drive a significant portion of our top line growth, despite continued pricing pressures. We anticipate Aerospace sales increasing in the range of 3.0% to 8.0%, with operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 17.0%. Full year 2017 Aerospace performance is dependent on a number of factors, including the receipt of governmental approvals for direct commercial sales of the JPF to foreign militaries, additional K-MAX orders and continued improvement in the performance of our metallic and composite structures programs. At Distribution, we expect that 2017 sales levels will range from a decrease of 1.0% at the low end of our range to an increase of 4.0% at the high end, with operating margins in the range of 4.9% to 5.3%. In 2017 we are focused on a return to organic sales growth and are taking necessary actions to achieve this objective, while maintaining disciplined cost control across the segment. Additionally, we expect to more fully realize the benefits of the productivity initiatives we implemented last year as we expect the associated costs to decrease significantly. We are pleased with the meaningful benefit these initiatives have delivered to date and are confident in our ability to achieve further operating margin improvement at Distribution in 2017. To provide insight into the cadence of earnings for the year, we anticipate a significant portion of our expected earnings will be weighted toward the second half of the year, with first quarter earnings representing less than 10% of our full year earnings. As we move through 2017, we expect earnings to increase sequentially with approximately 50% of our full year earnings occurring in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we anticipate a ramp-up of deliveries for the JPF and our bearings products throughout the year. As previously noted, the delay in receipt of U.S. Government approvals shifted JPF DCS deliveries out of 2016 and into 2017. Further impacting the earnings cadence, we expect that our JPF production capacity for the first nine months of the year will be largely utilized to fulfill our USG contract delivery requirements for 2017. Accordingly, we now anticipate that our higher margin JPF DCS deliveries will mostly occur during the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect cash flow performance to remain strong in 2017, with cash flows from operations in the range of $105 million to $135 million and Free Cash Flow* in the range of $70 million to $100 million. Given our stable and consistent cash flow generation of the last several years and the expected growth in 2017, we are pleased to announce an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share. Kaman has paid a dividend for forty-seven consecutive years, and when combined with our stock repurchase program, underscores our commitment to returning a significant amount of cash to our shareholders."" 2017 Outlook Our 2017 outlook is as follows: Distribution: Sales of $1,100.0 million to $1,150.0 million Operating margins of 4.9% to 5.3% Depreciation and amortization expense of $16.0 million Aerospace: Sales of $720.0 million to $760.0 million Operating margins of 16.5% to 17.0% Depreciation and amortization expense of $23.0 million Interest expense of approximately $16.0 million Corporate expenses of approximately $55.0 million Estimated annualized tax rate of approximately 34.5% Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $45.0 million Capital expenditures of approximately $35.0 million Cash flows from operations in the range of $105.0 million to $135.0 million; Free Cash Flow* in the range of $70.0 million to $100.0 million Weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 28.5 million Dividend Increase The Kaman Corporation board of directors has declared a regular quarterly dividend of 20 cents per common share, representing an 11% increase, which will be paid on April 6, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 21, 2017.

The Company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. We define the Non-GAAP measures used in this report and other disclosures as follows: Organic Sales - Organic Sales is defined as ""Net Sales"" less sales derived from acquisitions completed during the preceding twelve months. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, which can obscure underlying trends. We also believe that presenting Organic Sales separately for our segments provides management and investors with useful information about the trends impacting our segments and enables a more direct comparison to other businesses and companies in similar industries. Management recognizes that the term ""Organic Sales"" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances.

Sales days (""Sales Days"") are the days that the Distribution segment's branch locations were open for business and exclude weekends and holidays. Management believes Organic Sales per Sales Day provides an important perspective on how net sales may be impacted by the number of days the segment is open for business&nbsp;and provides a basis for comparing periods in which the number of Sales Days differs. The following table illustrates the calculation of Organic Sales per Sales Day using “Net sales: Distribution” from the “Segment and Geographic Information” footnote in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2017. Sales from acquisitions are classified as organic beginning with the thirteenth month following the acquisition. Prior period information is adjusted to reflect acquisition sales for that period as organic sales when calculating the change in Organic Sales per Sales Day. Table 5.

Adjusted EBITDA differs from net earnings, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that it excludes interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and other expense, net. We have made numerous investments in our business, such as acquisitions and capital expenditures, including facility improvements, new machinery and equipment, improvements to our information technology infrastructure and new ERP systems, which we have adjusted for in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect funds available for distributions, reinvestments or other discretionary uses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional perspective on the operating results of the organization and its earnings capacity and helps improve the comparability of our results between periods because it provides a view of our operations that excludes items that management believes are not reflective of operating performance, such as items traditionally removed from net earnings in the calculation of EBITDA as well as Other Expense, net. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating performance, as determined in accordance with GAAP. No other adjustments were made during the three-month and twelve-month fiscal periods ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The following table illustrates the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA using GAAP measures, ""Net Earnings"", ""Interest Expense, net"", ""Income Tax Expense"", ""Depreciation and Amortization"" and ""Other Expense, net"".

Management believes Free Cash Flow provides an important perspective on our ability to generate cash from our business operations and, as such, that it is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free Cash Flow should not be viewed as representing the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures such as dividends to shareholders or acquisitions, as it may exclude certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt and other contractual obligations. Management uses Free Cash Flow internally to assess overall liquidity. The following table illustrates the calculation of Free Cash Flow using “Net cash provided by operating activities” and “Expenditures for property, plant &amp; equipment”, GAAP measures from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this release.

Debt is defined as GAAP “Current portion of long-term debt” plus “Long-term debt, excluding current portion”. Capitalization is defined as Debt plus GAAP “Total shareholders' equity” and ""Temporary equity"". Management believes that Debt to Capitalization Ratio is a measurement of financial leverage and provides an insight into the financial structure of the Company and its financial strength.

Representatives then conducted a UAS flight demonstration during Harris’ Tech Expo being held February 27-March 3 in Melbourne. Harris will partner with the University of North Dakota and the Northern Plains UAS Test Site to develop the network infrastructure system under a Research North Dakota grant awarded by the North Dakota Centers of Excellence Commission. The grant includes the development of aviation-grade network services specifically for UAS operations. It is a continuation of a previous grant that included development and a risk and safety assessment of UAS detect-and-avoid technology. The UAS BVLOS network will be developed within the Grand Forks-to-Fargo corridor. Harris is working to create a regional infrastructure that is scalable to the whole state of North Dakota, and eventually to the entire U.S. Developing this high-performance networked infrastructure will help accelerate regulatory approval of BVLOS UAS operations. ""The use of UAS for business operations – such as remotely monitoring power lines, farms, and rail tracks – represents the future for many organizations,"" said George Kirov, vice president and general manager, Commercial UAS Solutions, Harris Electronic Systems. ""Harris is applying the same innovation and expertise that made us a leader in manned aircraft air traffic management solutions to integrate commercial UAS operations into the National Airspace System.” “By collaborating with the University of North Dakota and Harris, the Northern Plains UAS Test Site will have the opportunity to evaluate, develop, and implement a UAS network and airspace services,” said Nicholas Flom, executive director for the Northern Plains UAS Test Site. “This network will create a real-world environment for users to develop, test and certify new products and services.” “North Dakota is committed to creating an environment where organizations like Harris Corporation, the University of North Dakota, and the Northern Plains UAS Test Site may pursue new and exciting opportunities with UAS,” said Brian Opp, manager, Aerospace Business Development, North Dakota Department of Commerce. Harris is looking to partner with end users, such as railroads and electric utility companies in the area, to create UAS test scenarios. As the project continues, Harris expects to test scenarios including railway inspection, roadway inspection, transmission line inspection, precision agriculture, public safety and emergency services, expanded flight operations, and more.

Defense contractors and their subcontractors, suppliers, partners, and customers can use the multi-tenant, Software-as-a-Service solution to share documents containing covered defense information (CDI) with one another in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) directives for local and network access. Exostar arms DoD contractors w/latest secure collaboration technology to meet DFARS/NIST cyber compliance mandate.Tweet this These directives are an essential element of the 110 security controls identified in the recently-revised National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, which is incorporated by reference into the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) provision 252.204-7012. The provision defines how contractors and their geographically-distributed, multi-tiered supply chains must safeguard CDI from compromise. Failure to meet the provision by its deadline later this year will affect current and future contract awards. Exostar’s defense community of over 130,000 organizations immediately can take advantage of a seamless, straightforward, cost-effective path to compliance. Current and future community members benefit from features that deliver a compelling user experience and align with the NIST/DFARS cybersecurity requirements, including: Web-based Single Sign-On (SSO) access through Exostar’s identity and access management platform, following completion of onboarding, identity proofing, and credentialing processes conducted by Exostar. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), where individuals must present trusted credentials for verification each time they initiate a session within the enterprise collaboration solution or each time they access a local copy of a document. Individuals who fail to present a valid credential when challenged are denied access on-the-spot. Digital Rights Management (DRM) that encrypts documents at-rest on the local device, only decrypting and opening them following a real-time check of document policies and user permissions. When documents are updated or access permissions are modified, the changes are enforced immediately and cascade to every copy of the document regardless of where it is stored, supporting stringent access, version, and distribution control. “Encryption of documents at-rest in databases and in-transit between parties is insufficient in a sophisticated cyber threat landscape. The DFARS provision and NIST SP 800-171 standard reflect the need for protection to extend beyond systems and networks to local devices such as laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and USBs,” said Doug Russell, Exostar’s Vice President of Business Solutions. “Defense contractors large and small need an intuitive, high-performance, compliant solution to meet their internal and external collaboration needs, and that’s precisely what we deliver.” Leading domestic and global defense contractors including Northrop Grumman, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Airbus North America, Rolls-Royce, and BAE Systems have relied on Exostar’s proven enterprise collaboration solution for nearly a decade. Today, the solution is hosted in US and UK data centers, supporting the secure intra- and inter-enterprise collaboration endeavors of over 50,000 users in 60 countries worldwide. Attend the 3/7 Webinar with Baker Tilly to learn about DFARS/NIST 800-171 requirements and how to identify gaps/ensure readiness for compliance.

Engineered to swiftly replicate a network environment and mathematically predict the effects of real cyber exploits, AtomicEye RQ provides executives with visibility and investment accountability, and security operators with a detailed, up-to-the minute understanding of the vulnerabilities in their environment. This knowledge makes it easier to secure the network and invest intelligently in cyber defense tools. “Organizations are spending too much money on solutions and services to guess at the state of their security posture. AtomicEye RQ delivers analytical models capable of identifying critical network vulnerabilities, making it possible to measure and optimize an organization’s security configuration over time, even as changes are constantly occurring.”Tweet this Enterprises at all levels strive to address the question – “How secure is my environment?” – but have trouble producing an accurate answer. Many tactics used by organizations to determine some measure of security success, such as penetration tests and vulnerability scans, are limited in their effectiveness because they are expensive, rely upon old data, are limited in scale and scope, and are confined by rules of engagement. AtomicEye RQ eliminates these road blocks by using accurate, timely data directly from an enterprise’s network environment to develop a map of weaknesses. In order to develop this map, RQ clones a network configuration and deploys an unlimited combination of attacks on the virtual network. These experiments, compiled from a library of thousands of exploits and malware, are automatic, continuous, configurable, and reveal with certainty where vulnerabilities exist in the environment. Once deployed, RQ’s algorithms work in the background to constantly calculate and recommend the highest impact upgrades and repairs to the network. Security operators can turn their attention from reacting to thousands of alerts to proactively protecting their organization’s valuable assets. Over time, executives gain a quantifiable understanding of their organization’s security, and how their cyber defenses are performing. “Clients and CISOs have shared with us that securing their enterprise network with confidence and direction is a major obstacle that they are driven to find a solution for,” said Paul Farrell, CEO of Nehemiah Security. “Organizations are spending too much money on solutions and services to guess at the state of their security posture. AtomicEye RQ delivers analytical models capable of identifying critical network vulnerabilities, making it possible to measure and optimize an organization’s security configuration over time, even as changes are constantly occurring.” Nehemiah Security announced the acquisition of Siege Technologies in November 2016, and Triumfant in August 2016. It is Nehemiah Security’s goal to help clients solve the toughest cyber challenges. The announcement of AtomicEye RQ is the next step in Nehemiah Security’s plan to change the game for security operators through a more complete, intelligent cybersolution.

We caution the reader to carefully consider such factors. MACOM undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Discussion Regarding the Use of Historical Non-GAAP Financial Measures | In addition to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) reporting, MACOM provides investors with financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, such as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Income from Operations and Pro Forma credit agreement EBITDA. This non-GAAP information, as calculated pursuant to our credit agreement, excludes the effect, where applicable, of discontinued operations, intangible amortization expense, share-based compensation costs, impairment and restructuring charges, changes in common stock warrant liability, financing and litigation costs, acquisition and integration related costs, other costs and the tax effect of each adjustment. This non-GAAP information, as calculated pursuant to our credit agreement, includes consulting agreement related income associated with the Automotive divestiture. Management believes that these excluded items are not reflective of our underlying performance. Management uses Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Income from Operations and Pro Forma credit agreement EBITDA to: evaluate our ongoing operating performance and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, forecast future periods, evaluate potential acquisitions, compare our operating performance against peer companies and assess certain compensation programs. The exclusion of these and other similar items from our non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of our ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. This non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies because different companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Additional information and management’s assessment regarding why certain items are excluded from our Non-GAAP financial measures are summarized below: Amortization Expense - is related to acquired intangible assets which are based upon valuation methodologies, and are generally amortized over the expected life of the intangible asset at the time of acquisition, which may result in amortization amounts that vary over time. The expense is not considered by management in making operating decisions, and the expense is non-cash. Share-Based and Non-cash Compensation Expense - includes share based compensation including awards that are equity and liability classified on our balance sheet as well as non-cash compensation expense primarily associated with amounts due to employees of an acquired business that were placed in escrow at the time of the acquisition and amortized as expense over a 2-year period. Share Based Compensation expense is partially outside of our control due to factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our operating performance during the period in which the expense is incurred. It is an expense based upon valuation methodologies and assumptions that vary over time, and the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies due to factors that can be outside of their control. Share-based and Non-Cash Compensation Expense amounts are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Impairment Charges - includes expenses associated with our strategic decision to exit a product line and end programs with a license and technology transfer as well as certain related fixed assets and inventory. We believe these charges are one-time in nature and are not correlated to future business operations and including such charges does not reflect our ongoing operations. Restructuring Charges - includes amounts primarily associated with approved plans to reduce staffing and manufacturing or administrative footprints. We believe these amounts are not correlated to future business operations and including such charges does not reflect our ongoing operations. Litigation Costs - includes gains, losses and expenses related to the resolution of other-than-ordinary-course threatened and actually filed lawsuits and other-than-ordinary-course contractual disputes and legal matters. We exclude these gains and losses because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions. We believe such gains, losses and expenses do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized and the amount of such gains or losses and expenses can vary significantly between companies and make comparisons less reliable. Acquisition and Integration Related Costs - includes such items as professional fees incurred in connection with pre-acquisition and integration specific activities, post-acquisition employee retention amounts, contingent consideration adjustments, severance and other amounts accrued or paid to terminated employees of acquired businesses, costs including salaries incurred which are not expected to have a continuing contribution to operations or are expected to have a diminishing contribution during the integration period and the amortization of the fair market step-up value of acquired inventory and fixed assets. We believe the exclusion of these items is useful in providing management a basis to evaluate ongoing operating activities and strategic decision making. Discontinued Operations excluding consulting income - includes the profit and loss amounts of discontinued operations, with the exception of consulting income associated with a consulting agreement we entered into at the time of our Automotive business divestiture. We believe excluding gains and losses associated with historically divested businesses from our net income provides management with a comparable basis to our current ongoing operating activities. We do not exclude the consulting agreement income classified as discontinued operations because management views this income as part of our ongoing operations and correlated with future operations. Other - historical amounts primarily include transaction expenses incurred as part of our Credit Agreement Amendment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. We believe these amounts are not correlated to future business operations and including such charges does not reflect our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA - is a calculation that adds depreciation expense and consulting agreement income to our Adjusted Non-GAAP Income from Operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure that management reviews and utilizes for operational analysis purposes. We believe competitors and others in the financial industry utilize this Non-GAAP measure for analysis purposes. Credit Agreement Adjustments - are amounts which under our credit agreement we are required and or permitted to adjust in arriving at our consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA including certain share-based compensation amounts and certain estimated run rate savings and synergies associated with acquisitions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last Twelve Months Ended December | 30, 2016 (in millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MACOM &nbsp; &nbsp; AppliedMicro &nbsp; &nbsp; Proforma | Combined Income (loss) from operations - GAAP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 23.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ (32.8 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; $ (9.1 ) Amortization expense &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51.1 &nbsp; Share-based and non-cash compensation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 35.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 63.3 &nbsp; Impairment and restructuring charges &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (0.1 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18.3 &nbsp; Litigation costs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4 &nbsp; Acquisition and integration related costs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20.2 &nbsp; Other &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.6 &nbsp; Adjusted income from operations (Non GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 146.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 146.7 &nbsp; Depreciation expense &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26.6 &nbsp; Consulting income &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.4 &nbsp; Adjusted EBITDA (Non GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 174.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 180.7 &nbsp; Credit agreement adjustments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (5.0 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 56.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51.7 &nbsp; Pro Forma Credit agreement EBITDA (Non GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 169.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 63.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 232.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contacts Company Contact: | MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. | Stephen Ferranti, 978-656-2977 | Vice President of IR | stephen.ferranti@macom.com | or | Investor Relations Contacts: | Shelton Group | Leanne K.
